10/19/24, 2:33 AM - Om Nunase: Depends 🙃
10/19/24, 2:33 AM - R.M.: Do I need to read the whole book before going there?
10/19/24, 2:34 AM - R.M.: For how long will the interview continue?
10/19/24, 2:35 AM - Om Nunase: Advisable. But you should know in general about rocketry, watch some youtube videos and just think calmly and logically and be creative
10/19/24, 2:35 AM - Om Nunase: Mine was 40ish minutes
10/19/24, 2:36 AM - R.M.: Looks like I have to skip sleep today😭

10/19/24, 2:45 AM - Om Nunase: Do your best
10/19/24, 3:00 AM - R.M.: About propulsion only or rocketry as a whole??
10/19/24, 3:17 AM - Om Nunase: Propulsion
10/22/24, 7:52 AM - R.M.: What's this?
10/22/24, 9:10 AM - Om Nunase: Cubesat propulsion prototype
10/22/24, 11:44 AM - R.M.: Oh
10/30/24, 10:20 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
10/30/24, 10:21 AM - Om Nunase: Yes, but don't require it. Thanks <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 11:31 AM - R.M.: Umm why r u thanking me?u know what happened, actually yesterday I was feeling too sleepy after taking meds...to keep myself awake I was spinning this
10/30/24, 11:33 AM - R.M.: And by mistake I brought this with me
10/30/24, 11:34 AM - R.M.: Since u don't need it,can I keep it with me(just for staying awake)?or does someone else need it?
10/30/24, 12:39 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
10/30/24, 1:59 PM - R.M.: But, what exactly is this?harappa wheel or something? <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 2:48 PM - Om Nunase: It's for the edf
10/30/24, 2:48 PM - Om Nunase: I was testing out the constraints as I have to screw thebldc  motor onto this
10/30/24, 3:33 PM - R.M.: Full form?
10/30/24, 3:35 PM - R.M.: What exactly r u working on?
10/30/24, 3:35 PM - Om Nunase: Electric ducted fan
10/30/24, 3:37 PM - R.M.: Oh,so basically u r trying to make some propulsion vehicle?
10/30/24, 3:44 PM - Om Nunase: Ha
10/30/24, 4:16 PM - R.M.: Is it ur personal project or a team work?
10/30/24, 6:02 PM - Om Nunase: Personal
10/30/24, 6:03 PM - Om Nunase: After an year I don't believe in creating teams for something that's small and can be done by one person
10/30/24, 7:05 PM - R.M.: Oh so we can do anything and everything in shitty iitb?no one's going to stop us!?!
10/30/24, 7:57 PM - Om Nunase: Ofc
10/30/24, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: Just don't do something illegal and life threatening, ofc
10/30/24, 7:58 PM - R.M.: This is even more controversial
10/30/24, 7:59 PM - R.M.: What exactly is "life threatening"... it's iitb(india),so anything can b considered illegal here like branch change or related stuffs(if u know what I mean) <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 8:06 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
10/30/24, 8:58 PM - R.M.: Now that this stupid branch change topic came up,it reminded me of something else...like in iitd u can easily transition to a better branch in 2nd year even if u have a low cgpa but ur jee rank permitted it
10/30/24, 8:58 PM - R.M.: Like my friend was getting mechanical but he chose chemical
10/30/24, 8:59 PM - R.M.: Now if he feels like,he can easily take mechanical frm 2nd year (even if his cgpa is low)
10/30/24, 8:59 PM - R.M.: Is this allowed in stupid iitb?
10/30/24, 8:59 PM - Om Nunase: Nope
10/30/24, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: But don't worry
10/30/24, 9:00 PM - R.M.: So what the hell m I supposed to do? should I take a drop?
10/30/24, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: Noo
10/30/24, 9:00 PM - R.M.: I mean a partial drop
10/30/24, 9:00 PM - R.M.: Why?I have been thinking of this for the past few days
10/30/24, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: Aerospace is very much interdisciplinary
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - R.M.: Okk but u don't understand my current situation
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - R.M.: Wait...gimme a minute
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: I partially do
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: You like Aerospace
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: Ik
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
10/30/24, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: But why do you hate chemical?
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - R.M.: Read this
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - R.M.: We had to make a design assignment
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: That's tough
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - R.M.: And I wrote my current situation
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - R.M.: No u don't,no one can
...
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - R.M.: Yeah I'll send u that too...
10/30/24, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: Tell me if you wish
10/30/24, 9:03 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
10/30/24, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
10/30/24, 9:03 PM - R.M.: Bcoz my one and only motivation for jee was AEROSPACE...I didn't want to do engineering otherwise
10/30/24, 9:03 PM - R.M.: I wanted to study astrophysics actually
10/30/24, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: I understand
10/30/24, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: Astrophysics or Aerospace?
10/30/24, 9:04 PM - R.M.: And also I wasn't ready for this...
10/30/24, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: Astrophysics is about studying stars, aerospace is about getting there
10/30/24, 9:05 PM - R.M.: Initially astrophysics...but then I frm class 9 it was aero
10/30/24, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: I see
10/30/24, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: Same same
10/30/24, 9:05 PM - R.M.: So basically now I find no purpose of life
10/30/24, 9:05 PM - R.M.: Not at all...ur life is so smooth...
10/30/24, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: Look I'll tell you what happened with me till now
10/30/24, 9:06 PM - Om Nunase: The courses uptill now were very very basic and you could easily go through them if you self studied, say in this winter <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 9:06 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
10/30/24, 9:07 PM - R.M.: No u don't get it...my mental situation isn't permitting me to do anything
10/30/24, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: Why
10/30/24, 9:07 PM - R.M.: It's Depression
10/30/24, 9:07 PM - R.M.: ...
10/30/24, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: I see. What caused it?
10/30/24, 9:08 PM - R.M.: This sudden unexpected trauma,like if my jee rank wouldn't have permitted aero it would have been fine
10/30/24, 9:08 PM - R.M.: I would have adjusted
10/30/24, 9:09 PM - R.M.: But I wasn't ready for whatever happened
10/30/24, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: Can I ask what exactly happened?
10/30/24, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Exactly happened?
10/30/24, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Oh u mean josaa?
10/30/24, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
10/30/24, 9:10 PM - Om Nunase: *if you want to answer, otherwise it's ok
10/30/24, 9:10 PM - R.M.: Nah it's ok... it's kind of a long story actually
10/30/24, 9:10 PM - R.M.: But plz don't tell anyone this
10/30/24, 9:11 PM - R.M.: So,the day after jee adv,after calculating my marks I was confident enough of getting aero
10/30/24, 9:12 PM - R.M.: I kind of expected that the cutoff would b too high
10/30/24, 9:12 PM - R.M.: But I was confident that I would get iitk if not iitm
10/30/24, 9:12 PM - R.M.: So I told my parents as well that I will take aero and nothing else
10/30/24, 9:13 PM - R.M.: Initially they were like ok,they said do whatever u feel like
10/30/24, 9:14 PM - R.M.: But later on some stupid ppl told them that aero was a very narrow spectrum,so they were kind of concerned
10/30/24, 9:14 PM - R.M.: And they brainwashed me ...but since it was my love I didn't pay attention to them
10/30/24, 9:15 PM - R.M.: Then my dad fell ill,and it was like kind of serious...bcoz he too is kind of a overthinker like me🤣
10/30/24, 9:16 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
10/30/24, 9:16 PM - R.M.: But it was partially my fault,I never told them that it was my love since class 9
10/30/24, 9:16 PM - R.M.: They thought my rank wouldn't permit cs or ee,so I wanted aero
10/30/24, 9:17 PM - R.M.: So it was a tough decision...either my family or my love
10/30/24, 9:17 PM - R.M.: Still I went for aero only
10/30/24, 9:17 PM - R.M.: (I m kinda too heartless🤣)
10/30/24, 9:18 PM - Om Nunase: How did you got chemical?
10/30/24, 9:18 PM - R.M.: Then my stupid uncle(who's at Caltech chemical)
10/30/24, 9:18 PM - R.M.: Yeah saying
10/30/24, 9:18 PM - R.M.: But before that I had to elaborate a bit on other things as well
10/30/24, 9:18 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm
10/30/24, 9:19 PM - R.M.: He too said the same,that u can't flourish frm aero,take chemical ,we can provide u connections frm 2nd year onwards in usa
10/30/24, 9:19 PM - R.M.: And he brainwashed my parents completely
10/30/24, 9:19 PM - Om Nunase: That's the issue
10/30/24, 9:20 PM - R.M.: And tbh,we all r crazy abt usa
10/30/24, 9:20 PM - R.M.: So no one supported me at all...at one point of time I started doubting my own capability
10/30/24, 9:20 PM - R.M.: I too felt like I can never succeed if I take aero
10/30/24, 9:21 PM - Om Nunase: Did you told your uncle about how much you love aerospace?
10/30/24, 9:21 PM - Om Nunase: If he's in usa he must have known how much aero flourishes there
10/30/24, 9:21 PM - R.M.: Did he give me the chance to?u know what,he has completely adopted the usa culture...they just seek their own personal gains
10/30/24, 9:22 PM - R.M.: He literally told his daughter "do whatever I say,else forget about us"
10/30/24, 9:22 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
10/30/24, 9:23 PM - R.M.: Yeah stupid usa ppl
10/30/24, 9:23 PM - Om Nunase: That's bad
10/30/24, 9:23 PM - R.M.: I mean now my dad told him abt me
10/30/24, 9:24 PM - R.M.: He was like,u all could have told this earlier...then definitely I would have strongly suggested her to take aero
10/30/24, 9:24 PM - R.M.: He tried contacting me too,but I blacklisted and blocked him
10/30/24, 9:25 PM - R.M.: But that's not the thing...
10/30/24, 9:25 PM - Om Nunase: Then?
10/30/24, 9:25 PM - R.M.: Wait I m telling u
10/30/24, 9:25 PM - R.M.: I mean everything is interrelated
10/30/24, 9:26 PM - R.M.: That's why I said it's too complicated
10/30/24, 9:26 PM - R.M.: And that's why I told u that day that I don't feel like going home
10/30/24, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: Aaah
10/30/24, 9:27 PM - R.M.: He brainwashed my parents in such a way that even they said that if u get masters in  top 5 universities in usa, we'll afford it
10/30/24, 9:27 PM - R.M.: Else do whatever u feel like
10/30/24, 9:27 PM - R.M.: And this is obviously too tough
10/30/24, 9:27 PM - Om Nunase: But why would he do so?
10/30/24, 9:28 PM - R.M.: Also they said since u got in through female supernumerary,boys r going do better in aero since their rank was better
10/30/24, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: 😶‍🌫️
10/30/24, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: There's absolutely no sense in that
10/30/24, 9:29 PM - R.M.: Bcoz they acted like fools at that point of time...now they literally ask for forgiveness frm me everyday
10/30/24, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: Hypocrisy
10/30/24, 9:29 PM - R.M.: Now they say that they'll afford wherever I get in(even without scholarship)
10/30/24, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: I think this matter should go in legal hands
10/30/24, 9:30 PM - R.M.: Idts...bcoz my uncle isn't an Indian,so Indian laws won't apply on him
10/30/24, 9:30 PM - Om Nunase: Us laws?
10/30/24, 9:32 PM - R.M.: My parents were correct in their perspective,they just wanted the best for me ...bcoz they know very well that my upbringing is such that I won't b satisfied with a low paying job in ISRO or some Indian companies
10/30/24, 9:32 PM - R.M.: I can't do that now...bcoz for masters in aero some day I might need hus help
10/30/24, 9:32 PM - Om Nunase: Hmmm
10/30/24, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: Well then there's only one solution. Focus on present and future
10/30/24, 9:33 PM - R.M.: Actually my parents didn't understand that this whole thing would affect me in such a way
10/30/24, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: There are no physical doors that are closed for you
10/30/24, 9:33 PM - R.M.: Even therapies couldn't help
10/30/24, 9:34 PM - R.M.: Yeah but just like I said whenever I try to do anything,the past traumas haunt me in a serious way
10/30/24, 9:34 PM - Om Nunase: Try not to get affected by them
10/30/24, 9:35 PM - R.M.: That's why I like to spend time in tl, atleast I can have some peace
10/30/24, 9:35 PM - R.M.: It's not that easy
10/30/24, 9:35 PM - Om Nunase: Why
10/30/24, 9:35 PM - Om Nunase: You can train your mind
10/30/24, 9:36 PM - R.M.: Just like I  said it's difficult for ppl to understand my mental situation...
10/30/24, 9:36 PM - R.M.: Doctor said it'll take at least a year
10/30/24, 9:37 PM - R.M.: And taking my rigidity issues into consideration,it might take 2-3 years
10/30/24, 9:37 PM - Om Nunase: I don't know your exact state but I know how it feels to not achieve so and so
10/30/24, 9:38 PM - R.M.: See not achieving a thing is different from "cognitive rigidity depression"
10/30/24, 9:38 PM - R.M.: Like I know very well now I have lots of scopes for aero,even my parents will support me financially
10/30/24, 9:38 PM - Om Nunase: Oh
10/30/24, 9:39 PM - R.M.: Also I can explore anything and everything I feel like just in the way an aero person can do
10/30/24, 9:39 PM - R.M.: But this ocd prevents me frm focusing on everything
10/30/24, 9:39 PM - Om Nunase: Aah that's problematic <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 9:39 PM - R.M.: Acads,hobbies,food,sleep,etc.etc.
10/30/24, 9:40 PM - R.M.: Yeah very much and the only solution I can think of is killing that idiotic uncle of mine
10/30/24, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: That won't help
10/30/24, 9:41 PM - R.M.: I just want to KILL him ...I want to see his blood
10/30/24, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: Uhhh
10/30/24, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: Don't think in wrong direction
10/30/24, 9:41 PM - R.M.: Yeah many days ago I was thinking of killing myself
10/30/24, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: What
10/30/24, 9:42 PM - R.M.: But then I felt like it's too childish
10/30/24, 9:42 PM - R.M.: So I m still alive🤣
10/30/24, 9:42 PM - R.M.: And experiencing depression each and every day
10/30/24, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: Well that's dangerous
10/30/24, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Yeah that's why I have started taking anti depressnts
10/30/24, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Bcoz i don't want to end my life without seeing the end of it
10/30/24, 9:44 PM - R.M.: Btw,can I ask u a question?
10/30/24, 9:44 PM - Om Nunase: Yes?
10/30/24, 9:44 PM - R.M.: Be honest
10/30/24, 9:44 PM - R.M.: Do u think I can ever succeed in life
10/30/24, 9:44 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
10/30/24, 9:44 PM - R.M.: Or do u think my hopes can never come true?
10/30/24, 9:45 PM - Om Nunase: They can come true
10/30/24, 9:45 PM - R.M.: Bcoz each and every day I hope for a better tomorrow,but everyday is getting worse🥹
10/30/24, 9:46 PM - Om Nunase: 😶
10/30/24, 9:46 PM - R.M.: I know I have OCD,CRD...but that doesn't mean I have to experience all thes
10/30/24, 9:46 PM - Om Nunase: Try talking to ismp mentor
10/30/24, 9:46 PM - R.M.: R u telling this honestly??
10/30/24, 9:47 PM - R.M.: Plz I want an honest opinion
10/30/24, 9:47 PM - R.M.: Yeah they know it
10/30/24, 9:47 PM - R.M.: Even I spoke to Parsekar
10/30/24, 9:47 PM - Om Nunase: Yes I'm honestly saying this
10/30/24, 9:47 PM - R.M.: He's a good friend of my ismp
10/30/24, 9:47 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
10/30/24, 9:48 PM - R.M.: Wait,u knew abt this?
10/30/24, 9:48 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
10/30/24, 9:48 PM - R.M.: I mean Parsekar told u this?
10/30/24, 9:48 PM - R.M.: That I spoke to him?
10/30/24, 9:48 PM - R.M.: Ohk... that's kinda crazy,but it's ok🤣
10/30/24, 9:49 PM - R.M.: They can't help... actually I have just started taking antidepressants
10/30/24, 9:49 PM - R.M.: So it'll take time
10/30/24, 9:49 PM - R.M.: It has been only a month
10/30/24, 9:49 PM - Om Nunase: Well
10/30/24, 9:49 PM - Om Nunase: You will heal
10/30/24, 9:50 PM - R.M.: Even if I heal,I promise I'll kill  the person bcoz of whom I have OCD
10/30/24, 9:50 PM - Om Nunase: 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
10/30/24, 9:50 PM - Om Nunase: Well see
10/30/24, 9:50 PM - Om Nunase: Tell me
10/30/24, 9:51 PM - Om Nunase: What's the best you can do *now* to fulfill your passion for aerospace?
10/30/24, 9:51 PM - Om Nunase: *now* at this present moment
10/30/24, 9:51 PM - Om Nunase: Today
10/30/24, 9:51 PM - R.M.: Many ppl have different opinions,so ppl r making me confused
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - R.M.: So I really don't have an answer to this
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: What opinions?
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: Try to find this out
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: It could be making an rc plane
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: Watching YouTube videos on planes
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - R.M.: I have a horrible experience in this
10/30/24, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: Making drone, which you're doing
10/30/24, 9:53 PM - Om Nunase: That's fine you learnt right
10/30/24, 9:53 PM - Om Nunase: You can always start over again <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 9:53 PM - R.M.: I can't find any aero things in that... though yesterday Dhruv was talking about some control navigation (pid), but that was too boring
10/30/24, 9:53 PM - Om Nunase: It's boring ik
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - R.M.: In aerospace I m interested in aerodynamics and propulsion
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - Om Nunase: I like reading books on aero so I do that by going to library
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - R.M.: And I want something related to that
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - R.M.: Books?in Library I found a blue book
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - R.M.: Related to aerodynamics
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - Om Nunase: About?
10/30/24, 9:54 PM - Om Nunase: Acha
10/30/24, 9:55 PM - R.M.: Don't remember the name though
10/30/24, 9:55 PM - Om Nunase: Read that naa
10/30/24, 9:55 PM - Om Nunase: Is the course overwhelming?
10/30/24, 9:55 PM - R.M.: But I was feeling too nostalgic that day,so I didn't read it
10/30/24, 9:55 PM - R.M.: Again bcoz of past trauma
10/30/24, 9:55 PM - Om Nunase: Well

10/30/24, 9:57 PM - Om Nunase: You've survived till now
10/30/24, 9:57 PM - R.M.: Bcoz till now I didn't watch too much youtube
10/30/24, 9:58 PM - Om Nunase: Aah
10/30/24, 9:58 PM - Om Nunase: YouTube has a lot of educational content too
10/30/24, 9:58 PM - R.M.: And in ur openion what else can I do to overcome depression?
10/30/24, 9:58 PM - Om Nunase: Do what you love
10/30/24, 9:59 PM - R.M.: Books, youtube (myopia),what else?
10/30/24, 9:59 PM - R.M.: I loved many things...but after going into this state of depression I don't like doing anything
10/30/24, 9:59 PM - Om Nunase: I don't know whether I have depression or not but I was feeling sad for many months. Then I did what I loved including drawing and reading aerospace stuff
10/30/24, 9:59 PM - Om Nunase: Friends
10/30/24, 10:00 PM - R.M.: Yeah I do have friends
10/30/24, 10:00 PM - Om Nunase: Friends that inspire you
10/30/24, 10:00 PM - R.M.: Oh u mean like minded ppl?
10/30/24, 10:00 PM - Om Nunase: To pursue your dreams
10/30/24, 10:00 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
10/30/24, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: I too have many people I know whom I can talk with, but I like to stay with those who inspire me
10/30/24, 10:01 PM - R.M.: I found very few ppl in this insti with whom my vibes match
10/30/24, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: Cause company can influence a lot
10/30/24, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: At least you found
10/30/24, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: You don't need 100s of friends
10/30/24, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: Only a few that inspire you works
10/30/24, 10:02 PM - R.M.: But most of them just say forget aero
10/30/24, 10:02 PM - R.M.: They demotivate me a lot
10/30/24, 10:02 PM - Om Nunase: Forget them
10/30/24, 10:02 PM - R.M.: They say whatever happened is for good only
10/30/24, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: Prove them wrong
10/30/24, 10:03 PM - R.M.: And at that point,I doubt myself...can I ever succeed in aero? should I just forget it?
10/30/24, 10:03 PM - R.M.: Idk maybe they r right...maybe I m really worthless
10/30/24, 10:04 PM - R.M.: Suppose 2 ppl inspire u,at the same time 10 ppl demotivate u... what'll feel?
10/30/24, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: There will be people who make you doubt yourself
10/30/24, 10:04 PM - R.M.: I feel really worthless
10/30/24, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: It's upto you whom do you listen to
10/30/24, 10:05 PM - R.M.: So what should I do? should I go to iitd?🤣
10/30/24, 10:05 PM - Om Nunase: 🫥

10/30/24, 10:08 PM - R.M.: Like how can hobbies relieve stress
10/30/24, 10:09 PM - Om Nunase: Well they are the things you love and take out your time for them
10/30/24, 10:09 PM - Om Nunase: Like I love drawing and sketching
10/30/24, 10:09 PM - Om Nunase: I enjoy it
10/30/24, 10:09 PM - R.M.: To relieve depression,we need upsurge of dopamine and nor adraline... that's what I meant
10/30/24, 10:09 PM - Om Nunase: It relieves my stress
10/30/24, 10:10 PM - Om Nunase: Hobbies release dopamine afaik
10/30/24, 10:10 PM - R.M.: sorry,maybe I was going too much into bio🤣
10/30/24, 10:10 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
10/30/24, 10:10 PM - R.M.: Actually it's my habit to learn deeply about anything and everything possible 🤣
10/30/24, 10:10 PM - Om Nunase: That's nice
10/30/24, 10:11 PM - R.M.: Don't tell me it's related to aero 😂
10/30/24, 10:11 PM - R.M.: Except cs and electrical stuffs though
10/30/24, 10:11 PM - Om Nunase: Aayein?
10/30/24, 10:11 PM - Om Nunase: Some times yes
10/30/24, 10:12 PM - R.M.: I just hate cse or electrical related stuffs...leave alone going into depths
10/30/24, 10:12 PM - Om Nunase: That's fine
10/30/24, 10:13 PM - R.M.: That's not...I got a bc grade in cs 101🥹
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: Wait your grades are out?
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: How
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - R.M.: But keeping touch with him makes me even more sad <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - R.M.: Yeah only for cs
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: Oh
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - R.M.: Quizz 1+midsem
10/30/24, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: I see
10/30/24, 10:15 PM - R.M.: Also should I go for music therapy?
10/30/24, 10:15 PM - R.M.: Can that help?
10/30/24, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: I am not in a position to advise
10/30/24, 10:16 PM - R.M.: I want opinions
10/30/24, 10:16 PM - R.M.: Then I'll try out everything
10/30/24, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: If that helps then sure
10/30/24, 10:16 PM - R.M.: Bcoz  psychiatrists r only for meds
10/30/24, 10:16 PM - R.M.: They won't give openions
10/30/24, 10:17 PM - R.M.: Bcoz he was in a time when I made that blunder in josaa...so basically anything related to the past traumatizes me
10/30/24, 10:18 PM - R.M.: That's another reason why I hate home
10/30/24, 10:19 PM - R.M.: Ok,so since u r in aero I just want ur honest opinion
10/30/24, 10:19 PM - R.M.: What should I do for a strong LOR?
10/30/24, 10:19 PM - Om Nunase: I'll go extreme
10/30/24, 10:19 PM - R.M.: Yeah
10/30/24, 10:19 PM - Om Nunase: Imagine all people in the world know you've built a jet engine
10/30/24, 10:20 PM - Om Nunase: Who wouldn't choose you?
10/30/24, 10:20 PM - Om Nunase: Do something great
10/30/24, 10:20 PM - Om Nunase: Build something thats never built before <This message was edited>

10/30/24, 10:21 PM - R.M.: Yeah u r really talented unlike me
10/30/24, 10:21 PM - Om Nunase: Iq is useless to have
10/30/24, 10:21 PM - Om Nunase: I'm not
10/30/24, 10:22 PM - R.M.: Then how do u expect me to build something?
10/30/24, 10:22 PM - R.M.: Plz be a bit realistic
10/30/24, 10:22 PM - Om Nunase: I hate being realistic
10/30/24, 10:22 PM - R.M.: I mean something less than this pls
10/30/24, 10:22 PM - Om Nunase: It's not the way to grow
10/30/24, 10:22 PM - R.M.: Ok so that's why u like Alyssa ,got it😂
10/30/24, 10:23 PM - Om Nunase: Hehe 😅
10/30/24, 10:23 PM - R.M.: And how m I supposed to start frm? reading books?then going to tl and trying to implement them using my own creativity?
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - Om Nunase: Have you read the book Sapiens and Cosmos?
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - Om Nunase: Read them
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - R.M.: Nooo, what's that?
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - R.M.: Aero related books?
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - Om Nunase: Nope
10/30/24, 10:24 PM - Om Nunase: But they'll help you a lot
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - Om Nunase: Atleast watch the series cosmos by Carl Sagan
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - Om Nunase: It will open your mind
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - R.M.: In being unrealistic 😂
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - Om Nunase: 😅
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - R.M.: Is it there in Library?
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - Om Nunase: Well for that read Elon Musk's biography
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - Om Nunase: You'll get pdf
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - Om Nunase: I have Sapiens
10/30/24, 10:25 PM - R.M.: Again the same thing... myopia 🥹
10/30/24, 10:26 PM - R.M.: Hardcopy?
10/30/24, 10:26 PM - Om Nunase: Don't worry
10/30/24, 10:26 PM - Om Nunase: Don't worry. Turn on night light though
10/30/24, 10:26 PM - R.M.: What about hypermetropia then?
10/30/24, 10:27 PM - R.M.: Also,why do u have myopia then?😂
10/30/24, 10:27 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
10/30/24, 10:27 PM - Om Nunase: I got specs when I was in 4th class
10/30/24, 10:27 PM - R.M.: Wait... that's even more dangerous
10/30/24, 10:28 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
10/30/24, 10:28 PM - Om Nunase: It's not dangerous
10/30/24, 10:29 PM - R.M.: It is...bcoz there's a high chair u might have presbyopia in ur early 40s
10/30/24, 10:29 PM - R.M.: Actually I overthink a lot😂
10/30/24, 10:29 PM - R.M.: R they diff books?
10/30/24, 10:29 PM - Om Nunase: 😶‍🌫️
10/30/24, 10:29 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
10/30/24, 10:30 PM - R.M.: Just tell me what exactly they r related to?
10/30/24, 10:30 PM - Om Nunase: Sapiens is about human history
10/30/24, 10:30 PM - R.M.: Ohh damn...human evolution
10/30/24, 10:30 PM - Om Nunase: Cosmos is about the universe, astronomy, etc.
10/30/24, 10:30 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
10/30/24, 10:31 PM - R.M.: I loved that part in class 12 biology
10/30/24, 10:31 PM - R.M.: Then there's a 90% chance of liking it
10/30/24, 10:31 PM - Om Nunase: 101%
10/30/24, 10:32 PM - R.M.: Wait...u too love human evolution and astronomy?
10/30/24, 10:32 PM - Om Nunase: Ha
10/30/24, 10:32 PM - Om Nunase: I love how life evolved on Earth
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - R.M.: But ppl told me I m mad and there would b no one who would love aero, astronomy and human evolution
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - Om Nunase: Who told
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - R.M.: Looks like I m not the only one crazy
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - R.M.: Literally everyone
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - Om Nunase: Crazy people change the world 🔥
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - Om Nunase: That's weird
10/30/24, 10:33 PM - R.M.: In fact u r the only one who didn't
10/30/24, 10:34 PM - R.M.: Like Alyssa
10/30/24, 10:34 PM - Om Nunase: Interesting
10/30/24, 10:34 PM - Om Nunase: And Elon Musk, and every scientist, engineer, mathematician, designer, artist, etc....
10/30/24, 10:35 PM - R.M.: Yeah and that's why to start it by killing him
10/30/24, 10:35 PM - Om Nunase: Well
10/30/24, 10:35 PM - R.M.: Why?did u find anyone in this insti with such a crazy combination?
10/30/24, 10:35 PM - Om Nunase: By crazy I mean positive wala crazy. To bring a positive change
10/30/24, 10:36 PM - R.M.: Just kidding
10/30/24, 10:36 PM - R.M.: Yeah I got it
10/30/24, 10:36 PM - Om Nunase: Not yet
10/30/24, 10:36 PM - R.M.: See exactly...ppl will call u crazy when they learn u have this kind of a crazy combination
10/30/24, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: Let them

10/30/24, 10:38 PM - R.M.: Looks like u need to have something else,bcoz i already have those combo😂
10/30/24, 10:38 PM - Om Nunase: Achaa it's great talking with you and not good to leave in between but I've got some work

10/30/24, 10:38 PM - Om Nunase: No problem
10/30/24, 10:38 PM - Om Nunase: You didn't disturb
10/30/24, 10:38 PM - R.M.: Btw,u really made me feel better
10/30/24, 10:38 PM - Om Nunase: I'm glad
11/1/24, 12:04 AM - R.M.: What were the names of the books u said yesterday?
11/1/24, 12:14 AM - Om Nunase: Sapiens
11/1/24, 12:14 AM - Om Nunase: Cosmos
11/1/24, 12:29 AM - R.M.: Ok
11/1/24, 12:29 AM - R.M.: Just curious to know... scientific name of humans start with
11/1/24, 12:29 AM - R.M.: Homo Sapiens (...)
11/1/24, 12:31 AM - R.M.: Now this (...) depends on the era like neanderthalesis or sapies etc.
11/1/24, 12:32 AM - R.M.: But since this is only named Sapiens,does it have any proper meaning?I mean why did they remove the genus?
11/1/24, 12:33 AM - R.M.: Also,is it by Darwin or lamarck?
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - Om Nunase: Yuvak Noah Harari
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - R.M.: Who's he?
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - Om Nunase: Historian
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - Om Nunase: He's alive
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - Om Nunase: Also
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - Om Nunase: Happy Diwali 🪔
11/1/24, 12:34 AM - R.M.: Answer this na plz...u have read the book,so u must know this
11/1/24, 12:35 AM - R.M.: Oh yeah happy diwali+halloween 🎃
11/1/24, 12:35 AM - Om Nunase: It's the author's choice, I don't know why
11/1/24, 12:35 AM - R.M.: I mean is there any meaning of sapiens?
11/1/24, 12:36 AM - Om Nunase: Not literally
11/1/24, 12:36 AM - Om Nunase: But yeah it refers to humans
11/1/24, 12:36 AM - Om Nunase: Wise humans
11/1/24, 12:36 AM - R.M.: But Neanderthal man wasn't wise
11/1/24, 12:36 AM - R.M.: Afaik
11/1/24, 12:37 AM - R.M.: Still they r called Homo Sapiens Neanderthalesis
11/1/24, 12:39 AM - Om Nunase: Noo they're called Homo neanderthalensis
11/1/24, 12:39 AM - R.M.: But...
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - R.M.: Ig in the recent nomenclature it's Homo Sapiens Neanderthalesis
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - R.M.: And Homo Sapiens Sapiens
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - Om Nunase: I'm not aware of it
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - R.M.: The modern rule
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - Om Nunase: Is it?
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - R.M.: Yeah it was recently
11/1/24, 12:40 AM - Om Nunase: Interesting
11/1/24, 12:41 AM - R.M.: That's what I read in ncert class 12 bio <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 12:42 AM - R.M.: Still I'll confirm it once bcoz the last time I read bio was 4 months ago
11/1/24, 12:47 AM - Om Nunase: Haa
11/1/24, 12:53 AM - R.M.: Plz I'll confirm it in the morning... feeling very sleepy now <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 1:44 AM - Om Nunase: Sure
11/1/24, 8:28 AM - R.M.: Homo Sapiens Neanderthalesis is just a subclass of Homo Sapiens,then there is Homo Sapiens Sapiens,Homo Sapiens Futuris
11/1/24, 8:28 AM - R.M.: But this H.S.futuris is just a theoretical concept
11/1/24, 12:31 PM - Om Nunase: Ohk
11/1/24, 3:12 PM - R.M.: Then what can b the possible reason of this?is it cranial capacity?
11/1/24, 3:13 PM - R.M.: Bcoz Neanderthal man had more cranial capacity than us
11/1/24, 3:14 PM - R.M.: But again shouldn't futuris have less capacity?bcoz this concept is use and disuse of  organs
11/1/24, 3:16 PM - R.M.: Like it's predicted they'll b tall,have 4 toes,etc.So I was thinking since digital era is rotting our thinking ability, shouldn't futuris have low cranial capacity?
11/1/24, 3:33 PM - Om Nunase: The future is unknown
11/1/24, 3:34 PM - Om Nunase: Ad I think it will most likely be decided by humans themselves via genetic engineering
11/1/24, 3:34 PM - R.M.: But in that case
11/1/24, 3:34 PM - R.M.: How r they so sure abt 4 toes
11/1/24, 3:34 PM - Om Nunase: Dont know
11/1/24, 3:35 PM - R.M.: Afaik the prediction is via disuse of organs
11/1/24, 3:35 PM - R.M.: Also one more thing
11/1/24, 3:35 PM - R.M.: Is cranial capacity related to wisdom or something else?
11/1/24, 3:35 PM - Om Nunase: Somewhat
11/1/24, 3:35 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah neanderthals had more brains than us
11/1/24, 3:36 PM - Om Nunase: But more brain also means a hefty diet
11/1/24, 3:36 PM - R.M.: So were they more intelligent?
11/1/24, 3:36 PM - R.M.: How?
11/1/24, 3:36 PM - Om Nunase: Brain requires a lot of nutrition
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - R.M.: Oh
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - R.M.: Oh so were they the ones who buried their dead?
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - R.M.: Or was it cro magnon man?
11/1/24, 3:37 PM - Om Nunase: It was neanderthals ig
11/1/24, 3:38 PM - R.M.: Wait
11/1/24, 3:38 PM - R.M.: They had more brain,does it mean they had complex hormonal and neural coordination as well?
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - R.M.: In that case, their life would have been much more complex
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - Om Nunase: Need to searching
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - R.M.: I tried searching many books
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - R.M.: Didn't find these answers...
11/1/24, 3:39 PM - R.M.: Tried asking ppl,ppl said I m crazy
11/1/24, 3:40 PM - Om Nunase: You asked the wrong people, simple enough
11/1/24, 3:40 PM - Om Nunase: Ask historians and archeologicalist
11/1/24, 3:40 PM - Om Nunase: Not engineers
11/1/24, 3:40 PM - R.M.: I asked my teachers and friends..
Who else m I supposed to ask?
11/1/24, 3:40 PM - R.M.: I didn't ask them
11/1/24, 3:40 PM - Om Nunase: Try mailing professors
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - R.M.: Where can I find a prof in history?
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah many of those people aren't curious enough
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - R.M.: In a shitty college
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - Om Nunase: IITB has
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - R.M.: Where ppl r interested only in placements not in knowledge
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - Om Nunase: Don't curse
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah ik
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - Om Nunase: You're right
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - R.M.: What m I supposed to do,no one is interested in knowledge
11/1/24, 3:41 PM - R.M.: You deleted this message
11/1/24, 3:42 PM - Om Nunase: In that case yes
11/1/24, 3:42 PM - R.M.: Ppl think I m crazy bcoz I m interested in learning
11/1/24, 3:42 PM - R.M.: So what can I expect from india
11/1/24, 3:42 PM - R.M.: Few days ago u were asking me why I hate india,right?
11/1/24, 3:42 PM - Om Nunase: The one who's interested in learning will travel further
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - R.M.: So the ans is this
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - R.M.: And this
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - Om Nunase: Hmmmmm
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - Om Nunase: Agreed
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - R.M.: Yeah one more question
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah there's a better atmosphere for research outside
11/1/24, 3:43 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
11/1/24, 3:44 PM - R.M.: Btw m I disturbing u a lot by asking stupid questions
11/1/24, 3:44 PM - R.M.: It was related to marxman law
11/1/24, 3:44 PM - Om Nunase: No question is stupid
11/1/24, 3:45 PM - Om Nunase: Who knows what questions will lead to a great discovery
11/1/24, 3:45 PM - R.M.: But I m made to believe that I m crazy 🤣
11/1/24, 3:45 PM - R.M.: Wait...lemme think how to ask abt it
11/1/24, 3:46 PM - R.M.: Bcoz it was quite a long doubt
11/1/24, 3:46 PM - R.M.: In a nutshell tell me what exactly was the problem with the rectangular substrate that they had to switch over to cylinder?
11/1/24, 3:47 PM - Om Nunase: Substate?
11/1/24, 3:47 PM - R.M.: I mean what exactly was the problem in the equation
11/1/24, 3:48 PM - R.M.: Wait...it was frm AIAA research paper ig
11/1/24, 3:48 PM - R.M.: Let me search for the exact equation
11/1/24, 3:48 PM - Om Nunase: Ohk
11/1/24, 3:50 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 3:50 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 3:50 PM - R.M.: And this
11/1/24, 3:51 PM - R.M.: During combustion, shouldn't local instantaneous regression rate and oxidiser mass flux be same?
11/1/24, 3:51 PM - Om Nunase: You just shifted from human evolution to rockets
11/1/24, 3:51 PM - Om Nunase: Anyways
11/1/24, 3:51 PM - R.M.: Yeah...u know what, actually I have lots of doubts in lots of topics 🤣
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - R.M.: So I m asking whichever is coming to my mind🤣
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - R.M.: Like I have doubts in aeroplanes and biotechnology as well
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - Om Nunase: Rectangular to cylindrical?
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - Om Nunase: The grain
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - R.M.: But I don't remember it exactly
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - R.M.: Yeah
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - R.M.: Should I send u the entire paper?
11/1/24, 3:52 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
11/1/24, 3:53 PM - R.M.: Wait
11/1/24, 3:53 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
11/1/24, 4:16 PM - R.M.: Don't u have this marxman eq in 2nd year?
11/1/24, 4:17 PM - R.M.: Then m I overstressing myself too much?😂
11/1/24, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: Naah
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - Om Nunase: I read advanced stuff
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - Om Nunase: College is easy
11/1/24, 4:18 PM - R.M.: Is it even there in bachelors then?
11/1/24, 4:19 PM - R.M.: Yeah I should have taken aero😭 chemical is too difficult, that's what seniors say
11/1/24, 4:25 PM - Om Nunase: You would have been bored
11/1/24, 4:48 PM - R.M.: I mean at iitm,bcoz iitm is more research oriented and aero is the best in iitm
11/1/24, 4:49 PM - R.M.: Better than being depressed 😥
11/2/24, 5:39 PM - R.M.: Just came across something called "insti nite"... Is it even worth attending?
11/2/24, 5:39 PM - R.M.: I mean did u have a good experience in ur 1st year?
11/2/24, 5:40 PM - R.M.: Actually I don't believe the advertisements any more...the way they advertised halloween was so catchy...but in reality it wasn't even close to what we usually celebrate
11/2/24, 6:35 PM - Om Nunase: It's like mini mood indigo
11/2/24, 6:35 PM - Om Nunase: What's the venue?
11/2/24, 8:26 PM - R.M.: OAT
11/2/24, 8:29 PM - R.M.: Does moodi also take place in oat?
11/2/24, 8:32 PM - R.M.: Still,is it better than halloween?
11/2/24, 9:51 PM - R.M.: Also,is cs 101 and philosophy endsem usually difficult or almost of the same level as compared to midsems? <This message was edited>
11/2/24, 10:28 PM - Om Nunase: Don't know about philosophy
11/2/24, 10:28 PM - Om Nunase: Who's your instructor for cs?
11/2/24, 10:29 PM - Om Nunase: No, it takes place in Gymkhana
11/2/24, 10:31 PM - R.M.: Manoj Prabhakaran
11/2/24, 10:32 PM - R.M.: Does question pattern and grading depend on prof? <This message was edited>
11/2/24, 11:49 PM - Om Nunase: Well I don't know
11/3/24, 1:24 AM - R.M.: Did u have the same prof?
11/3/24, 1:25 AM - Om Nunase: No that's why
11/3/24, 1:25 AM - R.M.: So,who did you have?
11/3/24, 2:25 PM - R.M.: R u a coordinator of moodi?
11/3/24, 2:26 PM - R.M.: If yes, can u please arrange a single room for me
11/3/24, 2:29 PM - Om Nunase: No
11/3/24, 2:29 PM - Om Nunase: It's difficult
11/3/24, 2:30 PM - R.M.: Why is it difficult?
11/3/24, 2:30 PM - R.M.: How exactly m I going to stay in sharing room?
11/3/24, 2:31 PM - R.M.: Bcoz now I have a single room and earlier also I used to stay alone
11/3/24, 2:32 PM - R.M.: I mean what exactly do I need to do to get one?
11/3/24, 3:26 PM - Om Nunase: I don't know
11/3/24, 3:26 PM - Om Nunase: Ask some mood I coordie
11/3/24, 3:26 PM - Om Nunase: Huh?
11/3/24, 4:28 PM - R.M.: Yeah odd number of girls in chemical (and aero too)
11/3/24, 4:38 PM - Om Nunase: I see
11/4/24, 8:08 PM - R.M.: Did u go to tl anyday after halloween?if yes,did u by chance see any meds on the table with the name "d veniz" <This message was edited>
11/4/24, 8:08 PM - R.M.: Yellow tablets
11/4/24, 8:08 PM - R.M.: 100 mg
11/4/24, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: Nope 🫤
11/4/24, 8:27 PM - R.M.: Plz try to recall na... they r very important for me... it's like without them I m literally dead...also I can't just ask anyone else bcoz i don't feel like narrating my sad story 😭 <This message was edited>
11/4/24, 8:27 PM - R.M.: And if by mistake someone else takes it,the negative effect of it will b dominating
11/4/24, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: I didn't went to TL
11/4/24, 10:16 PM - R.M.: Accha np, I'll go and check it myself
11/14/24, 1:24 PM - R.M.: Can u recommend a good telescope
11/14/24, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: You want to buy?
11/14/24, 7:47 PM - R.M.: Yeah that has been one of my longest dreams since 3rd std
11/14/24, 7:47 PM - R.M.: Till now I have saved around 30k for it
11/14/24, 7:48 PM - R.M.: Will that b enough?or do I need to save a bit more?
11/14/24, 7:48 PM - R.M.: But yeah in the range of 3 lakhs plz
11/14/24, 7:51 PM - Om Nunase: Enough for a decent telescope
11/14/24, 7:51 PM - R.M.: Ok then suggest a telescope
11/14/24, 7:56 PM - Om Nunase: I have a 13 cm aperture 900mm telescope
11/14/24, 7:56 PM - Om Nunase: It's good
11/14/24, 7:56 PM - Om Nunase: Skywatcher
11/14/24, 7:57 PM - Om Nunase: If your budget allows, go for an automatic one
11/14/24, 7:57 PM - Om Nunase: And try to get the maximum aperture possible
11/14/24, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: I don't have a list of telescope but I can tell you what exactly to look for when buying one
11/14/24, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Actually I don't want to change telescopes frequently
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - R.M.: Like once I buy one,I want to keep it forever
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: Ofc
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - R.M.: So, that's why I m saying which is the best
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: Do you want to take it while travelling?
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - R.M.: Travelling in the sense?
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - R.M.: U mean foreign?
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: Going to hill tops
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - R.M.: Oh yeah obviously
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe
11/14/24, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: Far from home
11/14/24, 8:04 PM - R.M.: Hmm ofc I will
11/14/24, 8:04 PM - Om Nunase: Cassegrains are great! They're compact, have large focal length and produce an upright image
11/14/24, 8:04 PM - Om Nunase: Reflecting telescopes are decent
11/14/24, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: Don't go for refracting ones. They'll spoil the mood because of chromatic abberation
11/14/24, 8:05 PM - R.M.: What's the usual price for these?
11/14/24, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: 1 lakh+
11/14/24, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: INR
11/14/24, 8:06 PM - R.M.: Ok...so I need to save ig,in that case maybe 2 more years (maybe then the price will rise)
11/14/24, 8:06 PM - R.M.: And these?
11/14/24, 8:07 PM - R.M.: Also, what's the lifespan of a normal telescope?
11/14/24, 8:07 PM - Om Nunase: Depends on how you keep it 🙃
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - R.M.: And how exactly should we keep it
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: They're cheap relatively
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - R.M.: Like?
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: Always put a lid on the telescope
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: Never allow dust to settle in the mirrors
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - R.M.: I mean where should I place it?can I keep it in my room?
11/14/24, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: Cassegrains therefore are great as dust won't go inside the telescope
11/14/24, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: While in reflecting telescopes, dust on the mirror will decrease the image quality
11/14/24, 8:09 PM - R.M.: Accha so basically they have a lot of advantages
11/14/24, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: And make sure to wipe the dust with a special solution and don't put fingerprints on any optical stuff like mirrors and lenses
11/14/24, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
11/14/24, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: They're compact
11/14/24, 8:10 PM - Om Nunase: Reflecting mei you have either a Newtonian mount, or a Dobsonian mount
11/14/24, 8:10 PM - R.M.: Now where on earth should I get this "special" solution frm??
11/14/24, 8:10 PM - Om Nunase: Dobs are great too. They are available in large sizes
11/14/24, 8:10 PM - Om Nunase: You'll get them
11/14/24, 8:11 PM - R.M.: But??they r going to add to budget too😭
11/14/24, 8:11 PM - R.M.: So,in a nutshell cassegrain is the best?
11/14/24, 8:11 PM - Om Nunase: Yup if the budget allows
11/14/24, 8:12 PM - Om Nunase: If you can get an automated one, that's, take it
11/14/24, 8:12 PM - R.M.: Automated cassegrain is the name of the telescope, right?
11/14/24, 8:12 PM - Om Nunase: Yup you'll get it
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - R.M.: Or does it have some numbering?
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - Om Nunase: Search
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - R.M.: I don't want to😭
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - Om Nunase: And first pick the one with the highest aperture
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - Om Nunase: 🫥
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - R.M.: I mean how will I know which is the best
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - Om Nunase: Perhaps Krittika can help
11/14/24, 8:13 PM - R.M.: Ok got it
11/14/24, 8:14 PM - R.M.: I don't trust them
11/14/24, 8:14 PM - Om Nunase: What!
11/14/24, 8:14 PM - R.M.: Bcoz if I approach a convenor, they r surely going to ask my department...in that case I will try to avoid that question
11/14/24, 8:14 PM - R.M.: Then they won't help me
11/14/24, 8:15 PM - R.M.: Or maybe they might lie
11/14/24, 8:15 PM - Om Nunase: 😬😬😬
11/14/24, 8:15 PM - Om Nunase: Trust
11/14/24, 8:16 PM - R.M.: Yeah they might have a negative impression when I m going to do this... obviously I m not going to tell them the truth
11/14/24, 8:16 PM - Om Nunase: Uhhh
11/14/24, 8:16 PM - Om Nunase: What?
11/14/24, 8:16 PM - R.M.: So,once I buy cassendra,I won't have to change it right?
11/14/24, 8:17 PM - R.M.: *cassegrain
11/14/24, 8:19 PM - R.M.: The reason why I took chemical...so it's better if I don't tell them my department
11/14/24, 8:20 PM - R.M.: Cassegrain? <This message was edited>
11/14/24, 8:27 PM - Om Nunase: No reflecting
11/14/24, 8:30 PM - R.M.: ...
11/14/24, 8:30 PM - R.M.: So reflecting will come in around 70k s?
11/14/24, 8:35 PM - Om Nunase: Mine is 23k
11/14/24, 8:51 PM - R.M.: And was that recently or many years ago?
11/14/24, 8:51 PM - R.M.: Also, suddenly I realised there's a serious problem
11/14/24, 8:52 PM - R.M.: I mean how r we supposed to travel with it by planes?they might get scratched😥 <This message was edited>
11/14/24, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: They've telescope cases
11/14/24, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: Ig when I was in 7th
11/14/24, 9:12 PM - R.M.: So around 6 years ago...is it still fully functional?
11/14/24, 9:13 PM - R.M.: So what!! stupid "Indian" domestic airline authorities...what if they somehow ruin it😥 <This message was edited>
11/14/24, 9:38 PM - Om Nunase: 💀💀💀
11/14/24, 9:38 PM - Om Nunase: Haven't checked yet 😅
11/14/24, 10:18 PM - R.M.: Is it really true?r chickens really this flexible??😶 <This message was edited>
11/14/24, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
11/14/24, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: Yess <This message was edited>
11/14/24, 10:38 PM - R.M.: But it's possible with cats too...why did they exclusively select hens?
11/14/24, 10:39 PM - Om Nunase: Is it?
11/14/24, 10:39 PM - R.M.: Yeah I tried it with my pets once
11/14/24, 10:39 PM - R.M.: Not for all... especially those fat male cats
11/14/24, 10:50 PM - Om Nunase: Hehe
11/15/24, 1:30 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
11/15/24, 1:32 AM - R.M.: Also,r the wings of all planes inclined at the same angle to the horizontal?or does it change acc to manufacturing model?
11/15/24, 1:33 AM - R.M.: Like suppose in Airbus a320 and Boeing 737,r the angles same?
11/15/24, 8:56 AM - Om Nunase: Depends on the airfoil and how much lift you want to generate
11/15/24, 10:21 AM - R.M.: Oh,so in different models the airfoil is different?
11/15/24, 11:41 AM - Om Nunase: Yup I suppose
11/15/24, 12:28 PM - R.M.: But aren't all models almost the same(Normal commercial aircrafts)?
11/15/24, 12:29 PM - R.M.: They have a slight difference in size...in that case,the angle should b almost the same
11/15/24, 12:29 PM - R.M.: Or does it depend on some other factors?
11/15/24, 2:26 PM - Om Nunase: You said Airbus vs boeing
11/15/24, 3:06 PM - R.M.: I just took two random models for comparison (just for example)
11/15/24, 3:11 PM - R.M.: Ok,so suppose if we take the example of 747-8 and 777X-9
11/15/24, 3:13 PM - R.M.: Or just any 2 random models (x and y) which r exactly same,just there's a slight difference in wt and MTOW
11/15/24, 3:13 PM - R.M.: Then will the angles b the same?
11/15/24, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: I don't think they will be
11/15/24, 6:16 PM - R.M.: Oh so even a slight difference in wt and MTOW can cause a great diff in angle?
11/15/24, 6:22 PM - R.M.: Or will the difference in angle b tending to 0...in that case will that even be a problem in real life? <This message was edited>
11/15/24, 8:38 PM - Om Nunase: The angle of attack right?
11/15/24, 8:44 PM - R.M.: Dihedral angle
11/15/24, 8:45 PM - R.M.: Like not only in wings...in tail too <This message was edited>
11/15/24, 8:54 PM - Om Nunase: It's a design choice
11/15/24, 8:54 PM - Om Nunase: You'll need to consider other things as well
11/15/24, 8:54 PM - R.M.: Like?
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: Mission
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - R.M.: Aerodynamic forces
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - R.M.: Mission?
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: The purpose of the plane
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - R.M.: I was talking about normal aeroplanes
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: Normal 😂
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: Civilian
11/15/24, 8:55 PM - R.M.: Commercial planes
11/15/24, 8:56 PM - R.M.: Idk whatever...the planes that we see almost everyday
11/15/24, 8:56 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
11/15/24, 8:56 PM - Om Nunase: Read this book
11/15/24, 8:56 PM - Om Nunase: You'll get an idea
11/15/24, 8:56 PM - R.M.: Which one?u sent me 2 books
11/15/24, 8:56 PM - Om Nunase: Aircraft design
11/15/24, 8:57 PM - R.M.: Is it there in the library?
11/15/24, 9:00 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
11/15/24, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: Yup
11/15/24, 11:06 PM - R.M.: Is it understandable for beginners?
11/16/24, 1:23 AM - Om Nunase: Bruh
11/16/24, 1:23 AM - Om Nunase: You aren't a beginner
11/16/24, 1:23 AM - Om Nunase: No fresher is
11/16/24, 9:02 AM - R.M.: I meant beginner in the field of eng
11/16/24, 9:03 AM - R.M.: 10+2 was so different...there we could set goals and study accordingly
11/16/24, 9:07 AM - R.M.: Like for example...in class 10,I realised that to get into iitm aero,marks of less than 50% is needed
11/16/24, 9:08 AM - R.M.: But with increasing competition,I realised it might rise to 50%(easy paper)...and I prepared accordingly and got exactly the same in adv🥲
11/16/24, 9:09 AM - R.M.: But I realised, that's not possible in engineering anymore 😭
11/27/24, 8:02 AM - R.M.: What's this?is it some prototype of mobile launch pad for desert environment?
11/27/24, 9:05 AM - Om Nunase: 🔥
11/27/24, 9:05 AM - Om Nunase: Well you have a great imagination
11/27/24, 9:05 AM - Om Nunase: But no
11/27/24, 9:06 AM - Om Nunase: It's a solar panel wagon to be mounted on a tesla, thus making the largest solar power vehicle
11/27/24, 10:56 AM - R.M.: Oh,was this initiative taken by energy club or something (don't remember the name exactly...the one dealing with sustainable environment)?
11/27/24, 10:57 AM - R.M.: Only land or aerial as well?
11/27/24, 10:58 AM - R.M.: They tried to mount the wagon on this?
11/27/24, 11:31 AM - Om Nunase: Land
11/27/24, 11:31 AM - Om Nunase: Yes exactly
11/27/24, 11:31 AM - Om Nunase: Solar butterfly is an organisation. The energy club of iitb helped them get here
11/27/24, 11:39 AM - R.M.: It's an organisation in Mumbai itself?or a world renowned thing?
11/27/24, 11:40 AM - R.M.: Oh so,this whole thing was kind of an exhibition ?
11/27/24, 11:41 AM - R.M.: Doesn't any such aero organisation ever come to iitb?
11/27/24, 11:41 AM - Om Nunase: World
11/27/24, 11:41 AM - Om Nunase: 🤔 hmm
11/27/24, 11:41 AM - R.M.: Nice... that's crazy
11/27/24, 11:42 AM - R.M.: When was this exhibition done?
11/27/24, 11:42 AM - Om Nunase: Yesterday
11/27/24, 11:42 AM - R.M.: Sometime after 23?
11/27/24, 11:42 AM - R.M.: Why does everything take place when I m not in India😭
11/27/24, 3:57 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
11/27/24, 7:11 PM - R.M.: Which camera do u use to take eye catching pics like these?
11/27/24, 7:13 PM - R.M.: Yesterday I tried capturing such kind of a moment from Athens airport...but it was too blurry 😢
11/27/24, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: Phone
11/27/24, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: It's not that clear though
11/27/24, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: Try this
Iso 500
Exposure time ~3 sec
11/27/24, 9:23 PM - R.M.: iPhone?
11/27/24, 9:23 PM - R.M.: Okk
11/27/24, 9:26 PM - R.M.: Wait...were all these pics taken frm behind the glasses of the airport?
11/27/24, 9:28 PM - R.M.: Bcoz even after this, won't the pics b still blurry?
11/27/24, 9:30 PM - Om Nunase: Realme XT
11/27/24, 9:30 PM - Om Nunase: Keep it somewhere
11/27/24, 9:30 PM - Om Nunase: Hands will definitely shake the camera unless you're a surgeon or an artist
11/27/24, 11:29 PM - R.M.: Then we need to hire an artist/surgeon bodyguard ig😂
11/28/24, 12:03 AM - Om Nunase: 🫠
11/28/24, 12:03 AM - Om Nunase: A tripod would be cheaper in my opinion
11/28/24, 12:40 AM - R.M.: But
11/28/24, 12:42 AM - R.M.: We can just take surgeon relatives, which comes free of cost, unlike tripod which still needs to b bought 😁
11/28/24, 1:09 AM - Om Nunase: 🫠
11/28/24, 8:15 AM - R.M.: Nah now I m sure it's not camera or anything, it's talent
11/28/24, 8:15 AM - R.M.: Anyways, congrats
12/4/24, 8:11 PM - R.M.: Or maybe comparison with Tiangong Space Station would have been better 🤣
12/4/24, 8:11 PM - Om Nunase: 🙃
12/4/24, 8:22 PM - R.M.: Bcoz iss is open for all (irrespective of nationality),unlike TSS(only Chinese)
12/4/24, 8:24 PM - R.M.: Just like iitb... except fourthies all r literally thrown out of the college bcoz of slavery at a young age of 22(placements)😡
12/4/24, 9:06 PM - Om Nunase: Huh?
12/4/24, 10:10 PM - R.M.: I meant bcoz of placement season,ppl r forced to vacate their hostel rooms
12/4/24, 10:10 PM - R.M.: And even if ppl r given rooms, it's sharing 🥹
12/4/24, 10:11 PM - R.M.: And all these torture is for the placement ppl
12/4/24, 10:12 PM - R.M.: Placement can b compared to slavery bcoz ppl have to work under their boss at just the age of 22😢
12/4/24, 10:13 PM - R.M.: Sad life😭😭
12/4/24, 10:24 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
12/4/24, 10:30 PM - R.M.: And u know what the most ironic thing is...ppl r proud to say that they have got a high paying job at 22
12/4/24, 10:30 PM - R.M.: But this isn't what life is supposed to b...
12/4/24, 10:33 PM - R.M.: Life is supposed to be full of risks and adventures
12/4/24, 10:34 PM - R.M.: Sorry, maybe I became too philosophical
12/4/24, 10:35 PM - R.M.: Actually I m just fed up of fickle minded majority Indians who think I opted engineering bcoz of placements
12/4/24, 10:35 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah I'm fed up of that too
12/4/24, 10:36 PM - R.M.: Aerospace... that's another stigma,ppl think aero is either NASA or ISRO <This message was edited>
12/4/24, 10:38 PM - R.M.: I told them several times Aerospace is a vast field
12/4/24, 10:39 PM - R.M.: But stupid ppl seem to b too rigid to understand reality
12/4/24, 11:22 PM - Om Nunase: Weird
12/5/24, 12:57 AM - R.M.: Yeah they r,but what's more weird is that they r iitians
12/5/24, 12:57 AM - R.M.: *freshies though
12/6/24, 8:17 PM - R.M.: Do u by chance remember the syllabus of ma 110 before midsem?is it linear algebra or differential equation?
12/7/24, 2:49 AM - Om Nunase: Linear algebra
12/7/24, 8:24 AM - R.M.: Okk
12/15/24, 12:06 PM - R.M.: "elite group of spacefaring nations"...nice sarcasm
12/15/24, 12:08 PM - R.M.: Vyomanauts🤣
12/15/24, 12:29 PM - Om Nunase: Wdym?
12/15/24, 12:29 PM - Om Nunase: I don't think it's funny
12/15/24, 3:30 PM - R.M.: Uhh...I didn't mean to offend you, actually "vyom" was a person during Samudragupta's reign
12/15/24, 3:34 PM - R.M.: Vyom was actually a traitor <This message was edited>
12/15/24, 3:34 PM - R.M.: So,ISRO choosing this name is really funny
12/15/24, 3:37 PM - R.M.: I mean India doesn't have proper budget+brain drain issue+not giving ppl their due respect=not possible
12/15/24, 4:34 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
12/15/24, 5:58 PM - R.M.: Umm...if u don't mind,can I ask u the meaning of this emoji?
12/15/24, 7:45 PM - Om Nunase: Lol. Melted face. Means disappointed
12/15/24, 8:56 PM - R.M.: Then why is the face smiling??
12/15/24, 9:35 PM - R.M.: One more thing...
12/15/24, 9:35 PM - R.M.: In ph110 is only sp theory of relativity there or is general there as well?
1/24/25, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: You participating in lavani?
1/24/25, 10:28 PM - R.M.: Yeah...on 29th(Dharohar)
1/24/25, 10:29 PM - R.M.: *(I m a bharatnatyam dancer though)🤣
1/25/25, 1:04 AM - Om Nunase: Nicee
1/25/25, 1:04 AM - Om Nunase: Interesting
1/25/25, 2:22 AM - R.M.: Everything's fine except that ltpcsa stage is too small to dance properly 😭
1/25/25, 9:55 AM - Om Nunase: 😂😂😂
2/1/25, 12:17 PM - R.M.: What's drone GC?some inter hostel drone competition??
2/1/25, 12:30 PM - Om Nunase: Yep
2/1/25, 12:30 PM - Om Nunase: You can participate next year!
2/1/25, 1:09 PM - R.M.: When's it?
2/1/25, 1:10 PM - R.M.: Also does it require participants to b all nighters few days before the competition like dance gc?
2/1/25, 3:01 PM - Om Nunase: Nah
2/1/25, 3:01 PM - Om Nunase: It was chill
2/1/25, 5:19 PM - R.M.: But wasn't it boring... again drone after makerspace in 1st year😥
2/1/25, 5:19 PM - R.M.: It should have been some other aero thing, just like in dance we have different forms to explore <This message was edited>
2/1/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: We'll at least for me it was different
2/1/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: Didn't had drones in maker space 🫠
2/1/25, 8:01 PM - R.M.: Ohh,then what did y'all have?
2/1/25, 8:30 PM - Om Nunase: Well there was an obstacle course
2/1/25, 8:31 PM - Om Nunase: But most of he team couldn't clear first two obstacles
2/1/25, 8:31 PM - Om Nunase: They had made the whole track with efforts 🫠
2/1/25, 8:35 PM - R.M.: How many obstacles were there?
2/1/25, 8:36 PM - R.M.: Still,ms grading is very lenient...ppl usually get>=9 <This message was edited>
2/1/25, 8:37 PM - R.M.: Ohh... that's really sad and relatable too😭😭
2/1/25, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: Yeh
2/9/25, 11:45 AM - R.M.: Latest aero related movie??book? <This message was edited>
2/9/25, 1:50 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
2/9/25, 1:50 PM - Om Nunase: Interstellar nhi dekha?
2/9/25, 2:11 PM - R.M.: Uhh...is it some kind of a famous movie?
2/9/25, 2:14 PM - R.M.: I have no clues about movies bcoz I feel they kill imagination, except the parts which have classical beats(suitable for classical dance😂)
2/9/25, 2:14 PM - Om Nunase: This movie improves imagination
2/9/25, 2:19 PM - R.M.: What exactly is it about?? something happening in space?
2/9/25, 2:20 PM - R.M.: And is Krittika screening it recently?
2/9/25, 3:17 PM - Om Nunase: No
2/9/25, 3:17 PM - Om Nunase: You can watch on movies2watch website
2/14/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
2/14/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Bcoz i think Mach number of free stream and free stream density should b the same in both, isn't it?
2/14/25, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: What I think about this is in airfoil 8, see the slit.
I think jet engine sucks air from that slit also so that at higher angles of attack the airflow doesn't seperate
2/14/25, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: What do you think
2/15/25, 12:53 AM - R.M.: Ohh yeah...
2/15/25, 12:53 AM - R.M.: So the difference is due to Reynolds number,right?
2/15/25, 12:53 AM - R.M.: Bcoz coefficient of lift depends on angle of attack,mach number of free stream and Reynolds number
2/15/25, 12:54 AM - R.M.: 1st 2 can't b different
2/15/25, 12:54 AM - R.M.: So the only difference can b R
2/15/25, 12:55 AM - Om Nunase: R would be same na?
2/15/25, 12:56 AM - R.M.: Would dynamic pressure b the same?
2/15/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: I'm visualising this problem only
2/15/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Haven't really thought of the math
2/15/25, 12:57 AM - R.M.: Won't turbulent airstream cause change in pressure
2/15/25, 12:57 AM - R.M.: So that'll change R
2/15/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Adding a slit reduces boundary later thickness <This message was edited>
2/15/25, 12:58 AM - R.M.: So what about dynamic pressure? <This message was edited>
2/15/25, 12:58 AM - R.M.: Should it change?
2/15/25, 1:01 AM - R.M.: And how do u prove it mathematically?
2/15/25, 1:29 AM - Om Nunase: You can think intuitively, haven't thought of mathematically but a good question
2/15/25, 8:28 AM - R.M.: I kind of tried proving it...but stress is becoming a complex function of slit width and all which led to nowhere 😭😭 <This message was edited>
2/15/25, 8:29 AM - R.M.: But it's difficult to believe scientific facts unless they r proved mathematically,bcoz common sense can deceive us,unlike maths(ex:lorentz transformation)
2/15/25, 8:40 AM - R.M.: If boundary layer is thin,slit configuration will b more prone to damage in turbulent weather conditions as compared to normal one
2/15/25, 8:41 AM - R.M.: Is it like that?..i tried guessing it, didn't find it anywhere
2/15/25, 9:05 AM - Om Nunase: Stress? Or stress rate? In fluid we use stress rate and strain rate
2/15/25, 10:18 AM - R.M.: I used stress...in fluids why's rate used?bcoz it fluctuates with time?
2/15/25, 10:23 AM - R.M.: So in fluids do torque and all depends on time?
2/15/25, 5:21 PM - Om Nunase: Yep
2/15/25, 7:08 PM - R.M.: Uhh so in that case,for ideal, incompressible fluids is stress more preferable over stress rate?
2/15/25, 8:02 PM - Om Nunase: No. Things are still flowing. In fluids we use strain rate
2/15/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: Still,say a fluid is completely uniform and inviscid,so at different times,the number and type of particles at a particular surface area will always b the same
2/15/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: In that case,time will b just an insignificant parameter
2/15/25, 8:37 PM - Om Nunase: If it were uniform, how is there a strain then?
2/15/25, 11:35 PM - R.M.: Oh yeah, sooorryy!!
2/15/25, 11:37 PM - R.M.: So,in a nutshell...for fluids(be it liquids or gases),we use stress and strain rate unlike solids,right?
2/15/25, 11:38 PM - R.M.: Except the case where mach number is very very less, almost tending to 0
2/15/25, 11:56 PM - Om Nunase: Whats the point then 🫠
2/16/25, 12:00 AM - R.M.: Our DIC prof said innumerable times that the basic difference between a good scientist and an engineer is approximation🤣 <This message was edited>
2/16/25, 12:01 AM - R.M.: So that's what I m saying: without any sort of approximation,like suppose there's a fluid flowing very slowly,but it's not a solid
2/16/25, 12:02 AM - R.M.: In that case,if we use strain instead of rate,from a scientist point of view,will it b unacceptable?
2/16/25, 12:20 AM - Om Nunase: We'll still use strain rate
2/22/25, 9:59 PM - Om Nunase: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqSpQzTE6M-dBFxRgkO66kzgePWuHPHF&si=oHe3149m5t8uFAk8
With the exception of a few topics, everything until like week5 of this courses is similar to ours
2/22/25, 10:50 PM - R.M.: Which course? AE 223?AE 344?
2/22/25, 10:50 PM - Om Nunase: AE244 low speed aerodynamics
2/22/25, 10:50 PM - R.M.: Uhh... ultimately IITM🤣
2/22/25, 10:50 PM - Om Nunase: :)
2/22/25, 10:52 PM - R.M.: Aerodynamics...wait so Euler and all comes under aerod?
2/22/25, 10:54 PM - R.M.: So high speed aerod involves those supersonic jets and all?
2/23/25, 12:15 AM - Om Nunase: Yeah, compressible flows
2/23/25, 12:15 AM - Om Nunase: You know NPTEL right?
2/23/25, 11:08 AM - R.M.: Yeah,but why?
2/23/25, 11:09 AM - R.M.: The one that goes by the name of AE 339?
2/23/25, 11:28 AM - Om Nunase: Just asking. Many juniors aren't ig
2/23/25, 11:28 AM - Om Nunase: I think so
2/23/25, 11:45 AM - R.M.: But it was really helpful for isi bstat prep
2/23/25, 11:46 AM - R.M.: Btw,I heard y'all had ph 110 ...how uld u rate the difficulty level?
2/23/25, 11:47 AM - R.M.: Isn't it a course of 4th sem?
2/23/25, 11:49 AM - R.M.: Afai remember in iitm or in iitk,they have it in 2nd year
2/23/25, 11:50 AM - Om Nunase: No
2/23/25, 11:51 AM - Om Nunase: Yeah. It was easy. The endsem was a bit difficult and lengthy
2/23/25, 11:55 AM - R.M.: Hence proved...iitm>>>>>iitb in aero 🤣
2/23/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: Uhh what!!endsem??
2/23/25, 11:57 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
2/23/25, 11:58 AM - R.M.: I was talking about this ...ppl told me y'all had the same paper like us
2/23/25, 12:40 PM - Om Nunase: Yup
2/23/25, 12:49 PM - R.M.: Was it really difficult?I mean I heard most ppl saying it was...but I felt it was easy -moderate
2/23/25, 12:50 PM - R.M.: Like ma 105 or ma 110
2/23/25, 12:52 PM - R.M.: Time in 2nd question was something in ln( ),right? <This message was edited>
2/23/25, 12:53 PM - R.M.: If u had the same paper like us,so will our cgpa b calculated with urs?
2/23/25, 1:20 PM - Om Nunase: Idk
2/23/25, 1:20 PM - Om Nunase: Ig
2/23/25, 1:53 PM - R.M.: Oh,then my procedure was correct...had a bit confusion in this.This was the best question in the whole paper.Rest were just applications
2/23/25, 2:39 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
3/1/25, 8:06 PM - R.M.: But this doesn't really provide an answer to my unsolvable equation 😭😭
3/1/25, 8:06 PM - Om Nunase: which one
3/1/25, 8:06 PM - Om Nunase: that airfoil one?
3/1/25, 8:07 PM - R.M.: Yeah😭😭
3/1/25, 8:07 PM - Om Nunase: yeah i asked my prof
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - R.M.: Have been trying it almost everyday 😭
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: he said that slot is for sucking in the boundary layer
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: seriously
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - R.M.: But what about maths?
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - R.M.: Yeah, obviously
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: :/
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: without numbers you cant do the math
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: oh ohk
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: you mean variables
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: like engine power and all
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - R.M.: Until it can b proved mathematically,we can't believe anything
3/1/25, 8:08 PM - Om Nunase: hmmm
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: nope
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - R.M.: So what...assume it constant in both cases na
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: one can work intuitively
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - R.M.: Or will it change?
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - R.M.: Ask ur prof to solve it mathematically
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: :O
3/1/25, 8:09 PM - R.M.: Else there's no point
3/1/25, 8:10 PM - R.M.: In believing facts😥
3/1/25, 8:11 PM - Om Nunase: theoretically, the boundary layer gets sucked and so the upper air which is more energetic now gets in contact with the surface.
3/1/25, 9:08 PM - R.M.: That upper layer will also have the same coefficient of viscosity,so it'll form another boundary layer
3/1/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: ha but it will be more energetic
3/1/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Still, energy will b a function of time
3/1/25, 9:10 PM - R.M.: *that's what I got after solving the equations
3/5/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: Hello
3/5/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: Hi
3/5/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: Sorry for that
3/5/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: How's the trad day going
3/5/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: It's very fun

3/5/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: Nice
3/5/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: Like better than Dharohar
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: Damn
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: You performed?
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: In both
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: Dharohar -lavani
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: Trads day-bharatnatyam
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: Great!
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: But it wasn't worth it😭
3/5/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: Opening performance
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: Very less audience 😭😭
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - Om Nunase: What
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - Om Nunase: Arey it's fine
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: Yeah...pure bharatnatyam,so council were like it should be 1st or 2nd😭😭
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - Om Nunase: They are not good ppl
3/5/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: No it's not...800 for dress and all ...too much for 2 mins😥
3/5/25, 8:01 PM - Om Nunase: But you can use that dress for other performance also na
3/5/25, 8:01 PM - R.M.: Na... it's a rented one🤣🤣
3/5/25, 8:01 PM - Om Nunase: 🙃
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Nvm...u too r going to dance in 27
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Bcoz the fourthies danced too
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah ig so
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - Om Nunase: Like why not
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: They were kinda forced🤣🤣
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - Om Nunase: 😬
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Bharatnatyam??
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Kathak?
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Lavani?
3/5/25, 8:02 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
3/5/25, 8:03 PM - R.M.: They did contemporary 🤣🤣

3/5/25, 8:03 PM - R.M.: 🤣🤣
3/5/25, 8:06 PM - Om Nunase: 🤡
3/5/25, 9:44 PM - R.M.: I meant live streaming of Neel's Garba performance...his garba moves r so accurate,I feel so jealous of him😭
3/5/25, 9:45 PM - R.M.: I take back my words,good u didn't come today
3/5/25, 9:47 PM - R.M.: They literally insulted aero ppl directly (especially aerodynamics 😠)
3/5/25, 9:48 PM - Om Nunase: what
3/5/25, 9:48 PM - Om Nunase: what happened
3/5/25, 10:01 PM - R.M.: Nothing that serious...it was kind of a shayari,but still,he shouldn't have done that
3/5/25, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: The duck
3/5/25, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: Who
3/5/25, 10:02 PM - R.M.: Idk...some thirdie most probably
3/5/25, 10:02 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
3/5/25, 10:02 PM - R.M.: Or maybe a fourthie
3/5/25, 10:02 PM - Om Nunase: Nvm
3/5/25, 10:02 PM - Om Nunase: Nvm
3/5/25, 10:02 PM - R.M.: Jee rank,aero ppl with no placements...blah blah
3/5/25, 10:03 PM - R.M.: Aero ppl should have studied a bit more during jee... nonsense
3/5/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: There are people who complain and then there are people who build great things
3/5/25, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: There's absolutely no relation between rank and your branch.
3/5/25, 10:04 PM - R.M.: So why did he do that in front of everyone
3/5/25, 10:04 PM - R.M.: Exactly...even our branch opener knows that
3/5/25, 10:09 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
3/6/25, 12:35 AM - R.M.: What's a good marks in ma110 linear algebra for cgpa of 10
3/6/25, 12:36 AM - R.M.: Like what was the cutoff previous year(if u do remember)
3/6/25, 12:37 AM - Om Nunase: :( idk
3/6/25, 12:38 AM - R.M.: Is 40.5/50 ok?
3/6/25, 12:39 AM - R.M.: Ig y'all had the same prof
3/6/25, 12:39 AM - R.M.: Bcoz ma110 is the same for all branches
3/6/25, 12:40 AM - Om Nunase: 40.5 for midsem? or combined midsem + quiz?
3/6/25, 12:40 AM - R.M.: Combined
3/6/25, 12:41 AM - R.M.: Midsem was 20.5/30
3/6/25, 12:41 AM - R.M.: Quiz was 10+10
3/6/25, 12:46 AM - Om Nunase: damn
3/6/25, 12:46 AM - Om Nunase: thats pretty good
3/6/25, 12:53 AM - R.M.: That's not...3 ppl in cs got 50
3/6/25, 12:55 AM - R.M.: Average is somewhere around 19.5
3/6/25, 12:56 AM - Om Nunase: well thats great
3/6/25, 12:58 AM - R.M.: How's that great...40.5-19.5=21...only a difference of 21 marks
3/6/25, 12:58 AM - R.M.: Very very risky to get a good cgpa😥
3/8/25, 3:45 PM - R.M.: How much did u get in ph 111?
3/8/25, 3:51 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
3/8/25, 3:51 PM - Om Nunase: Total 37ish
3/8/25, 4:12 PM - R.M.: Midsem?
3/8/25, 4:19 PM - R.M.: Out of 50?
3/8/25, 4:37 PM - Om Nunase: 17
3/8/25, 4:57 PM - R.M.: Really?but I heard a different range though
3/8/25, 4:57 PM - R.M.: Or is it 17 +_epsilon...where epsilon is a real number
3/8/25, 5:01 PM - Om Nunase: What
3/8/25, 5:02 PM - Om Nunase: 17/30
3/8/25, 5:02 PM - Om Nunase: Midsem
3/8/25, 5:08 PM - R.M.: But I heard u got in 20 to 25...but nvm,they might have some other plans
3/8/25, 5:10 PM - R.M.: Nice..
3/8/25, 5:12 PM - Om Nunase: they?
3/8/25, 5:16 PM - R.M.: Ayush and Naman...maybe it's just a side scheme which might lead to a greater plot
3/8/25, 5:17 PM - R.M.: Btw,did u really ask them for 3 servo motors,or was it part of the scheme too?
3/8/25, 5:17 PM - Om Nunase: What scheme
3/8/25, 5:18 PM - R.M.: Uhh now it's making sense...the plot is deeper than I expected it to b
3/8/25, 5:18 PM - R.M.: How m I supposed to read their minds,any scheme is possible at this point of time
3/8/25, 5:19 PM - R.M.: I meant...did u really ask them or did they lie to me as they have a different side scheme in mind?
3/8/25, 5:41 PM - Om Nunase: I asked them
3/8/25, 5:45 PM - R.M.: And they said?
3/8/25, 5:45 PM - R.M.: I mean obviously no one's going to confess
3/8/25, 5:49 PM - Om Nunase: he willgive me the servo
3/8/25, 5:49 PM - R.M.: Did u ask him the reason?
3/8/25, 5:49 PM - R.M.: Did he send u the recording?
3/12/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: Do u have anything called "multiphase flow and energy systems" as a part of core aerospace?
3/12/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: Or just "multiphase flow"
3/12/25, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: No clue 🙃
3/12/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: But didn't u have a course on thermodynamics or fluid mechanics? Multiphase is a part of that if I m not wrong?
3/12/25, 9:36 PM - Om Nunase: Not really
3/12/25, 10:50 PM - R.M.: Sorry sorry... actually it's a mtech course
3/12/25, 11:13 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
3/12/25, 11:33 PM - R.M.: How to approach the HOD for an official document? should I mail him?or should I directly visit his office?
3/12/25, 11:33 PM - Om Nunase: Which document?
3/12/25, 11:33 PM - Om Nunase: Which dept. HOD?
3/12/25, 11:34 PM - Om Nunase: You can visit your facad
3/12/25, 11:34 PM - R.M.: Just in general... system should be the same na
3/12/25, 11:34 PM - R.M.: But they strictly mentioned HOD
3/12/25, 11:34 PM - R.M.: Sadly chemical
3/12/25, 11:34 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah forward your doc through fac ad
3/12/25, 11:34 PM - Om Nunase: Tell your facad to forward
3/12/25, 11:35 PM - R.M.: So i need to explain the whole thing to the facad? <This message was edited>
3/12/25, 11:35 PM - Om Nunase: Umm yes
3/12/25, 11:35 PM - R.M.: Like I should send the whole letter to him
3/12/25, 11:35 PM - R.M.: By the facad
3/12/25, 11:35 PM - R.M.: ?
3/12/25, 11:35 PM - R.M.: This is completely unacceptable

3/12/25, 11:36 PM - Om Nunase: Is it application letter
3/12/25, 11:36 PM - Om Nunase: Or acceptance
3/12/25, 11:37 PM - R.M.: They have been asking for acceptance letter frm hod now
3/12/25, 11:37 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm
3/12/25, 11:37 PM - R.M.: But how the hell m i supposed to do that?

3/12/25, 11:41 PM - R.M.: They r giving vague answers
3/12/25, 11:41 PM - Om Nunase: I think it's given in the internship website
3/12/25, 11:41 PM - Om Nunase: What
3/12/25, 11:41 PM - R.M.: I asked them,they r literally asking me back what did the prof tell me😂🤣
3/12/25, 11:41 PM - Om Nunase: There should be a mention somewhere

3/12/25, 11:46 PM - R.M.: If not anything, I'll just stay near the huge aeroplane model near the aero department... doesn't really matter
3/12/25, 11:46 PM - Om Nunase: 😯
3/12/25, 11:47 PM - R.M.: What matters is just setting foot on iitm aero department...just like Neil Armstrong set foot on moon🙂
3/12/25, 11:47 PM - R.M.: But,plz don't tell anyone about this whole thing before 14th may <This message was edited>
3/12/25, 11:48 PM - R.M.: *bcoz iitm strictly don't accept freshers...took me a great deal to convince prof

3/23/25, 5:48 PM - Om Nunase: No, coding
3/23/25, 6:07 PM - R.M.: What course is it?plz don't tell me it's low speed aerod...bcoz I was really planning to take it as a minor <This message was edited>
3/23/25, 6:08 PM - R.M.: Which course in aero doesn't have coding?bcoz I want some course as a minor which doesn't have coding at all
3/23/25, 6:12 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
3/23/25, 6:12 PM - Om Nunase: Coding is fun
3/23/25, 6:13 PM - R.M.: I already had a experience with cs 101

3/23/25, 6:13 PM - Om Nunase: Nah this is totally different
3/23/25, 6:13 PM - R.M.: In cs 101 it was just 7
3/23/25, 6:13 PM - R.M.: Else my spi would have been much better
3/23/25, 6:14 PM - Om Nunase: Well that's not s valid reason to hate it
3/23/25, 6:14 PM - R.M.: Same thing na...c++ and python
3/23/25, 6:14 PM - R.M.: No no I meant it was boring,so I didn't study cs 101 at all
3/23/25, 6:14 PM - R.M.: I used chatgpt in labs and all,so i didn't learn anything
3/23/25, 6:15 PM - R.M.: That's why I almost failed that course
3/23/25, 6:15 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
3/23/25, 6:15 PM - Om Nunase: No
3/23/25, 6:15 PM - Om Nunase: Python is fun
3/23/25, 6:15 PM - R.M.: U meant stats?
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - Om Nunase: And much more
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - Om Nunase: Learn python
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - R.M.: So what exactly is the course?stats or coding?
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - Om Nunase: I'm insisting
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah stats
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - R.M.: It's like maths na?
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - Om Nunase: Ehh kinda
3/23/25, 6:16 PM - R.M.: Ohh so it's like isi?
3/23/25, 6:17 PM - R.M.: Uhh u could have told that earlier...bcoz i preferred isi more than engineering <This message was edited>
3/23/25, 6:17 PM - R.M.: Yeah this seems fun
3/23/25, 6:17 PM - R.M.: Okk maybe I'll try to
3/23/25, 6:17 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
3/23/25, 6:18 PM - Om Nunase: Prof. Varun Bhalerao launches astronomy projects that demand python
3/23/25, 6:18 PM - R.M.: Maybe I should have taken isi instead of iit😭😭
3/23/25, 6:18 PM - Om Nunase: I didn't know then so couldn't take up the project
3/23/25, 6:18 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
3/23/25, 6:19 PM - R.M.: That computational dynamics thing?
3/23/25, 6:20 PM - R.M.: The one krittika ppl were talking about? <This message was edited>
3/23/25, 7:00 PM - Om Nunase: No
3/23/25, 7:00 PM - Om Nunase: SURP
3/23/25, 7:00 PM - Om Nunase: That also requires puthi btw
3/23/25, 7:42 PM - R.M.: What's this?some summer related projects?
3/23/25, 7:45 PM - R.M.: It's not bcoz of knowledge,profs usually don't take freshies and sophies, even if u r the best in insti
3/23/25, 7:46 PM - R.M.: So, what all projects r there in aero department? <This message was edited>
4/7/25, 5:26 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
4/7/25, 5:33 PM - R.M.: Yeah i saw this earlier...but had classes till 5:10+slight headache+team meet at night
4/7/25, 5:33 PM - R.M.: Why do they keep all these on weekdays 😭
4/7/25, 5:34 PM - R.M.: I really wanted to speak to him about current aero researches around the world 🥹
4/7/25, 7:17 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
4/15/25, 5:17 AM - Om Nunase: Hi. I wanted to ask how long is your internship?
4/15/25, 9:07 AM - R.M.: 14th may -19th july
4/15/25, 9:10 AM - R.M.: But since college is supposed to start frm 15th July,either I might come back on 15th or miss the 1st few classes (depends on the prof)
4/15/25, 11:02 AM - Om Nunase: Hmm I see
4/15/25, 11:17 AM - R.M.: Urs?
4/15/25, 11:24 AM - Om Nunase: I don't know whether I'm shortlisted for isro internship. That's for one month. Anoth internship is for 8-10 months
4/15/25, 11:33 AM - R.M.: 8-10 months?
4/15/25, 11:33 AM - R.M.: Which month?and what exactly is it about?
4/15/25, 11:38 AM - Om Nunase: Isro one is from 5th May
4/15/25, 11:39 AM - Om Nunase: After isro one. Not decided with founder yet
4/15/25, 12:49 PM - R.M.: To?and which centre? bangalore?
4/15/25, 1:09 PM - Om Nunase: Vssc
4/15/25, 2:14 PM - R.M.: But??what about sa cup then? it's the best time to visit america ig
4/15/25, 2:18 PM - R.M.: ISRO is nice but u could have taken esa to escape the extreme heat in India😅
4/15/25, 2:34 PM - Om Nunase: 🙃
4/15/25, 2:34 PM - Om Nunase: Do they offer
4/15/25, 3:11 PM - R.M.: No clue,like for American universities, mainly internships r for thirdies(that too if u have an extraordinary performance in the field u r applying for)
4/15/25, 3:13 PM - R.M.: In some universities they prefer ppl from different branches though (in ms and intern both)
4/15/25, 3:13 PM - R.M.: And for Indians there r lots of restrictions in America for aero😭
4/15/25, 3:14 PM - R.M.: But for esa ig they might since europe is much more liberal towards other nationalities in aero🥲
4/15/25, 3:42 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm do you know of any opportunities <This message was edited>
4/15/25, 4:14 PM - R.M.: Universities u mean?or esa,nasa?
4/15/25, 4:15 PM - R.M.: And which field exactly? aviation? astronautics? <This message was edited>
4/15/25, 4:56 PM - Om Nunase: Esa
4/15/25, 4:56 PM - Om Nunase: Anyone
4/15/25, 5:19 PM - R.M.: For these space agencies or defence,citizenship is required ig... that's the case in America
4/15/25, 5:19 PM - R.M.: This is bcoz of secret documents of their country
4/15/25, 5:19 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah ofc
4/15/25, 5:19 PM - R.M.: But I do know about the universities
4/15/25, 5:20 PM - Om Nunase: Oh
4/15/25, 5:20 PM - R.M.: And that's too difficult for Indians
4/15/25, 5:20 PM - R.M.: But it's worth giving a try
4/15/25, 5:20 PM - R.M.: +it can give u an easy opportunity if u want to work in nasa or esa in future
4/15/25, 5:21 PM - R.M.: Not in defence though 😭😭
4/15/25, 5:22 PM - R.M.: And I don't really know about esa,bcoz i never considered esa as an option till now🥲
4/18/25, 12:57 PM - Om Nunase: i was making a human powered aircraft this summer, that's why i asked this.
4/18/25, 1:15 PM - R.M.: That cycle one?or r u designing the fuselage from scratch?
4/18/25, 1:25 PM - Om Nunase: The human will pedal but haven't finalized anything yet
4/18/25, 2:00 PM - R.M.: But considering unsymmetrical structure,ig neutral point and cg needs to b calculated accurately, isn't it?+symmetric airfoils might create a lot of difficulties ig
4/18/25, 2:01 PM - R.M.: In that case why don't u implement some mechanisms which can be controlled by hand,like instead of pedalling by feet,why not by palms?
4/18/25, 2:02 PM - R.M.: Then it'll b beneficial for handicapped ppl as well
4/18/25, 2:05 PM - Om Nunase: im mkaing this as an engineering exercise, not as a form of transportatino
4/18/25, 2:24 PM - R.M.: Uhh got it
4/18/25, 2:25 PM - R.M.: But still ig this should hold for stability as well as adequate lift <This message was edited>
4/18/25, 2:47 PM - Om Nunase: There's no un symmetrical structure
4/18/25, 2:47 PM - Om Nunase: What are you talking about?
4/18/25, 3:24 PM - R.M.: Lol I meant in x direction...so the coordinates of cg and np will be  in the form (alpha,O),where this alpha needs to b calculated accordingly
4/18/25, 5:09 PM - Om Nunase: x is plane's fuselage direction I suppose. Of course
4/18/25, 5:49 PM - R.M.: I suppose u need good mathematicians bcoz calculating the parameters will b a herculean job,in case the material is also not uniform 😂
4/18/25, 5:53 PM - Om Nunase: well
4/18/25, 5:53 PM - Om Nunase: its fine
4/18/25, 6:00 PM - R.M.: Okk,all the best then
4/18/25, 6:00 PM - R.M.: Just asking out of curiosity,where do u get all these creative ideas frm?
4/18/25, 6:01 PM - R.M.: Tbh,the only creative ideas I get is complex solutions to solving a mathematical equation or say some arbitrary physical situation 😭
4/18/25, 6:04 PM - Om Nunase: well isnt that a different form of creativity too
4/18/25, 6:04 PM - Om Nunase: i just get these ideas by sitting alone and pondering
4/18/25, 6:04 PM - Om Nunase: i talk to myself a lot. a lot more than i talk with other people combined
4/18/25, 6:04 PM - R.M.: That's a form of frustration actually
4/18/25, 6:05 PM - Om Nunase: :(
4/18/25, 6:05 PM - Om Nunase: oh wait
4/18/25, 6:05 PM - R.M.: U feel like getting into a infinite loop of diophantine equations,Euler matrices and stuff
4/18/25, 6:05 PM - Om Nunase: you wrote "complex solutions" 😂
4/18/25, 6:05 PM - Om Nunase: you want simple solutions?
4/18/25, 6:05 PM - R.M.: Especially when none of them works out
4/18/25, 6:06 PM - R.M.: No...I just want a solution
4/18/25, 6:06 PM - R.M.: Be it simple or complex
4/18/25, 6:06 PM - R.M.: And when I approach ppl they just say we never thought of that earlier 😥
4/18/25, 6:06 PM - Om Nunase: why are you sad then
4/18/25, 6:07 PM - R.M.: So at the end I need to think of them on my own,and get into the loop😭
4/18/25, 6:07 PM - Om Nunase: you gave them a solution
4/18/25, 6:07 PM - R.M.: Have u ever thought of something for a week and then realised u r going nowhere
4/18/25, 6:07 PM - R.M.: And then starting from the sratch
4/18/25, 6:08 PM - R.M.: It's so frustrating 😥
4/18/25, 6:09 PM - R.M.: Yeah, that leads me to getting into the infinite loop 😂
4/18/25, 6:10 PM - R.M.: It took me around 2 weeks before I could finally get diophantine equations out of my mind
4/18/25, 6:10 PM - R.M.: It feels so stupid at the end of the day😭
4/18/25, 6:10 PM - Om Nunase: yup. but thats the fun part of the project
4/18/25, 6:10 PM - R.M.: Engineering project is different
4/18/25, 6:10 PM - Om Nunase: :-/
4/18/25, 6:10 PM - R.M.: I m talking about diophantine equations and stuff
4/18/25, 6:11 PM - Om Nunase: aah
4/18/25, 6:11 PM - R.M.: In engineering project,u have ur problem statement, rest depends on ur thinking ability and how u can use ur theoretical knowledge
4/18/25, 6:12 PM - R.M.: But say I try to solve some equation which no one has been able to solve yet
4/18/25, 6:12 PM - R.M.: So u just don't know what exactly u r doing
4/18/25, 6:13 PM - R.M.: At at the end of 2 or 4 weeks it comes out to b nothing 😥
4/18/25, 6:13 PM - Om Nunase: :(
4/18/25, 6:17 PM - R.M.: Accha got it what exactly u mean...looks like I need to b more connected to the earth first to get proper ideas which can really help humanity 😥
4/18/25, 6:18 PM - R.M.: Bcoz the other engineering ideas I get can in no way affect humanity in recent future😭
4/30/25, 9:52 PM - R.M.: Did u have fluid mechanics course in 2nd year?or do u have it nxt year?
4/30/25, 10:23 PM - Om Nunase: Nope
4/30/25, 10:56 PM - R.M.: Like in the new syllabus,it comes in the name fluid mechanics or something else?
4/30/25, 10:57 PM - Om Nunase: havent checked
5/1/25, 1:11 AM - R.M.: Kk
5/5/25, 12:36 AM - R.M.: What does AU grade mean?is it something better than AP?like excellent or something?
5/5/25, 1:02 AM - Om Nunase: Ig it means audit
5/5/25, 1:08 AM - R.M.: And that is?marks is not added to cpi?
5/5/25, 3:35 AM - Om Nunase: Maybe
5/5/25, 3:35 AM - Om Nunase: Idk
5/5/25, 3:35 AM - Om Nunase: 😭
5/5/25, 3:41 AM - R.M.: Doesn't make sense.Bcoz how can ppl get au in ma 110.It's a compulsory course for all ig
5/5/25, 3:43 AM - R.M.: Btw,in low speed aerod,how to get AP?
5/5/25, 3:44 AM - Om Nunase: Hello
5/5/25, 3:44 AM - Om Nunase: I'm going in an airplane
5/5/25, 3:45 AM - Om Nunase: You want to record any part of the flight?
5/5/25, 3:45 AM - R.M.: What exactly do u mean?
5/5/25, 3:45 AM - Om Nunase: Like takeoff, etc.
5/5/25, 3:45 AM - R.M.: Going to USA?
5/5/25, 3:45 AM - Om Nunase: Nah nah
5/5/25, 3:45 AM - Om Nunase: Trivandrum
5/5/25, 3:46 AM - R.M.: If possible record that spoilers part,ok?
5/5/25, 3:46 AM - R.M.: It looks sooooo nics
5/5/25, 3:47 AM - R.M.: I tried it many times,but something or the other happened bcoz of which I couldn't
5/5/25, 3:47 AM - R.M.: You deleted this message
5/5/25, 3:50 AM - R.M.: R u visiting iitm as well??
5/5/25, 4:52 AM - Om Nunase: No, VSSC
5/5/25, 8:09 AM - R.M.: Plz forgive my geography,i thought trivandrum is  somewhere near Madras😂
5/5/25, 12:51 PM - R.M.: But?so early? it's just 5th may.Not even a single day for summer vacation 😢
5/5/25, 12:51 PM - R.M.: Does it mean sophie year is too packed??
5/5/25, 6:00 PM - Om Nunase: That's your choice
5/5/25, 7:23 PM - R.M.: Only if getting into standford or Georgia or texas or etc. was my choice😭
5/5/25, 7:23 PM - Om Nunase: Stop complaining 🫠
5/5/25, 8:06 PM - R.M.: Okk captain🫡
5/6/25, 8:06 PM - R.M.: It's St Andrews beach,right?
5/6/25, 8:38 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/6/25, 8:38 PM - Om Nunase: How do you know?
5/6/25, 8:40 PM - Om Nunase: Nearby only
5/6/25, 8:40 PM - Om Nunase: Veli beach
5/6/25, 8:59 PM - R.M.: Bcoz my relative like in Kerala,and I have been there many times in the past(many years ago)
5/6/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: Just that I m very bad with place names,so I know it by Thiruvananthapuram, that's why I was confused when you said trivandrum 🤣
5/6/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: Ohh,then maybe it changed a bit in the past few years😢...bcoz honestly it looks like st andrew
5/6/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: No no, that beach is a bit to north
5/6/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: There's a sounding rocket launch on 21 st
5/6/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: North to?
5/6/25, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: Veli beach
5/6/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: It's in Kerala,right?
5/6/25, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah yeah
5/6/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: Yeah,so they look the same
5/6/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: Anyways,kerala is boring (especially during this month)
5/6/25, 9:05 PM - R.M.: Launch from veli beach?
5/6/25, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/6/25, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: No 💀
5/6/25, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: Thumba
5/6/25, 9:14 PM - R.M.: So like all the beaches r very near to each other?
5/6/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah sory of
5/6/25, 9:15 PM - R.M.: Hearing this name for the first time🤣
5/6/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: Sort
5/6/25, 9:15 PM - R.M.: Is it open for outsiders?
5/6/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: Really? ISROs first launch took place here
5/6/25, 9:16 PM - Om Nunase: There's a form which you have to fill
5/6/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: I m not really interested in ISRO as such
5/6/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: Yeah so maybe that's why I have never been here
5/6/25, 9:16 PM - Om Nunase: 😑
5/6/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: Neither nasa
5/6/25, 9:17 PM - Om Nunase: 🤨
5/6/25, 9:18 PM - R.M.: Like now I m really confused whether I m more interested in aeronautics or astronautics😢
5/6/25, 9:18 PM - R.M.: Difficult to choose minors😭😭
5/6/25, 9:18 PM - Om Nunase: Trust your gut
5/6/25, 9:20 PM - R.M.: Like the thing which I really wanted to do,they won't take me since I m an indian😭
5/6/25, 9:20 PM - Om Nunase: What's that
5/6/25, 9:20 PM - R.M.: Even if I change my nationality 😭😭
5/6/25, 9:20 PM - R.M.: America defence... don't judge🥲
5/6/25, 9:20 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
5/6/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: 🦅
5/6/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: There are Indian origin people there to
5/6/25, 9:25 PM - Om Nunase: Right?
5/6/25, 9:25 PM - R.M.: My gut feelings is only america defence 😭
5/6/25, 9:25 PM - Om Nunase: Go
5/6/25, 9:25 PM - Om Nunase: Why not
5/6/25, 9:25 PM - R.M.: Indian ppl research from a distant place
5/6/25, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: I mean in pentagon
5/6/25, 9:26 PM - R.M.: They r not allowed to learn the secrets of America defence
5/6/25, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/6/25, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: Obviously
5/6/25, 9:27 PM - R.M.: Then what's the point
5/6/25, 9:27 PM - Om Nunase: Well research more
5/6/25, 9:27 PM - Om Nunase: Perhaps you'll find a way out <This message was edited>
5/6/25, 9:28 PM - R.M.: For India,right?
5/6/25, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: America
5/6/25, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: Or whatever your goal is
5/6/25, 9:28 PM - R.M.: My goal isn't america aero
5/6/25, 9:29 PM - R.M.: My goal is accessing american defence secrets for the benifit of the world
5/6/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: 🤨🤨🤨🤨
5/6/25, 9:30 PM - Om Nunase: That's sus
5/6/25, 9:30 PM - Om Nunase: There is a better way. Research your own ideas and benefit the world
5/6/25, 9:33 PM - R.M.: Yeah i meant, using america defence resources for further research
5/6/25, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
5/6/25, 9:33 PM - R.M.: Not stealing their idea🤣
5/6/25, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: Research from scratch, nobody will say anything
5/6/25, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: You meant it
5/6/25, 9:33 PM - R.M.: Lol it'll take 130 years
5/6/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: While average lifespan is 80 ig
5/6/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: No i meant exposing their secrets to researchers all across the world
5/6/25, 9:34 PM - Om Nunase: And working life is 50
5/6/25, 9:35 PM - Om Nunase: You have AI at your disposal. They didn't had back then
5/6/25, 9:47 PM - R.M.: But still all researches should b very strong in maths
5/6/25, 9:47 PM - R.M.: Nd i m less than average
5/6/25, 9:47 PM - R.M.: So,no way😭😭
5/6/25, 9:47 PM - Om Nunase: Well atleast you know that
5/6/25, 9:48 PM - R.M.: Yeah bcoz iitb is a very average college,and 10 cpi in maths mean less than average 😭
5/6/25, 9:48 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/6/25, 9:48 PM - R.M.: I know I said aa but I really hoped for AP
5/6/25, 9:48 PM - R.M.: But I m a fool,so...
5/6/25, 9:48 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂‍↔️
5/6/25, 9:49 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/6/25, 9:49 PM - R.M.: She was soooo strong in maths,unlike me😢
5/6/25, 9:49 PM - Om Nunase: ☠️
5/6/25, 9:50 PM - R.M.: Working life is frm 25-80
5/6/25, 9:50 PM - R.M.: Average
5/6/25, 9:50 PM - Om Nunase: Depends
5/6/25, 9:51 PM - R.M.: On how long a person lives
5/6/25, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂‍↕️
5/6/25, 10:00 PM - R.M.: Also AI is so unreliable,it can't even solve a basic voltera equation
5/6/25, 10:00 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/6/25, 10:00 PM - Om Nunase: Use perplexity pro
5/6/25, 10:01 PM - R.M.: Can it solve diophantine properly?
5/6/25, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: Idts
5/6/25, 10:01 PM - R.M.: 🤣🤣
5/6/25, 10:13 PM - R.M.: So like r there any foreigners in ISRO?
5/6/25, 10:13 PM - R.M.: Ppl who got citizenship afterwards
5/6/25, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: No idea
5/6/25, 10:15 PM - R.M.: Didn't u check the whole place?
5/6/25, 10:15 PM - Om Nunase: Nope
5/6/25, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: Just arrived yesterday
5/6/25, 10:16 PM - R.M.: Ohh,makes sense
5/6/25, 10:17 PM - R.M.: But still,any European?like in iitb
5/6/25, 10:17 PM - Om Nunase: In iitb I think so yes
5/6/25, 10:18 PM - R.M.: Yeah I said r there Europeans in ISRO like in iitb?
5/7/25, 4:15 AM - Om Nunase: Idk
5/10/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: Was the natural beauty really like this?or is it ur talent to bring beauty to blant things?
5/10/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: Looks like Thames...😍 <This message was edited>
5/10/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: Talented ppl
5/10/25, 2:21 PM - Om Nunase: Happy birthday Rajanya ✈️🚀✨✨
5/10/25, 3:25 PM - R.M.: Thanks❤️
5/10/25, 3:30 PM - R.M.: Wow,u seem to read my mind...I really wanted this customized airplane cake 🥲
5/12/25, 9:46 PM - R.M.: Literally the best pic ever... portrays the earth being destroyed ,maybe nature is trying to convey something??😔
5/12/25, 9:52 PM - Om Nunase: To me it seems like the cloud is rising in into the sunlight (new hopes) above the darkness (the clouds below)
5/12/25, 9:55 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/12/25, 10:05 PM - R.M.: The clouds r of different shapes...one of volcanic eruption,one of an astronaut,a fighter plane,a bird, someone hugging their dead relative,other animals nearby
5/12/25, 10:05 PM - Om Nunase: 😶
5/12/25, 10:05 PM - R.M.: Which basically means the world has become a battlefield,and ppl r running out of the world (astronaut)
5/12/25, 10:05 PM - R.M.: Some ppl r dead
5/12/25, 10:05 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
5/12/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: And even animals r affected adversely
5/12/25, 10:06 PM - Om Nunase: I can't see though 😕
5/12/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: See very carefully...in the first instance i also didn't realise this
5/12/25, 10:10 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/12/25, 10:11 PM - R.M.: I feel something's really off...last night I had kind of a same dream,today clouds r like these...maybe it's not just a mere coincidence 😰
5/12/25, 10:21 PM - Om Nunase: Can you name them pls
5/12/25, 10:31 PM - R.M.: The yellowish large cloud in the background is volcanic eruption or war fire ...the 2 green circles in front is astronaut (the large one) and fighter plane(small one)
5/12/25, 10:32 PM - R.M.: The rest circles resembles the effect that war can have on humans and animals
5/12/25, 10:32 PM - R.M.: It's black bcoz of the devastating effect war has(resembling sadness)
5/12/25, 10:35 PM - Om Nunase: Damn
5/12/25, 10:35 PM - Om Nunase: So creative you are
5/12/25, 10:53 PM - R.M.: Thanks
5/12/25, 10:53 PM - R.M.: But I feel it's just a result of overthinking 😅
5/12/25, 10:55 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/14/25, 10:52 AM - R.M.: Is abhuday iitm ka rocket team?
5/14/25, 7:00 PM - Om Nunase: 😍
5/14/25, 7:00 PM - Om Nunase: Wait what's the wing there? Which planes
5/14/25, 7:01 PM - R.M.: They didn't let me go near the plane since I was super late today 😭
5/14/25, 7:01 PM - R.M.: Will check it tom(if I m able to get up in time)🤣
5/14/25, 7:02 PM - R.M.: And in lab,phones were strictly restricted 😭😭
5/14/25, 7:02 PM - Om Nunase: Same here
5/14/25, 7:02 PM - R.M.: Else those labs were much better
5/14/25, 7:02 PM - Om Nunase: 💲
5/14/25, 7:02 PM - R.M.: Literally the best place ever
5/14/25, 7:03 PM - R.M.: And here the department as a whole is much better than iitb
5/14/25, 7:03 PM - R.M.: The profs too
5/14/25, 7:07 PM - R.M.: Actually iitm as a whole is much better than iitb (except weather)🥲
5/14/25, 7:14 PM - Om Nunase: 🙏🏻
5/14/25, 7:46 PM - R.M.: I regret each and every minute coming here...bcoz after this,i can never accept iitb even a bit😢
5/14/25, 7:47 PM - R.M.: Can u imagine even marathi food is well prepared in iitm mess as compared to iitb mess
5/14/25, 8:01 PM - Om Nunase: 🫡
5/14/25, 8:10 PM - R.M.: I feel something's really off with iitb...like the btech students r still here for exams,so i could easily compare their and our culture
5/14/25, 8:11 PM - R.M.: Their culture is what an IIT is supposed to be...feels like a foreign University
5/14/25, 9:39 PM - Om Nunase: 🥲
5/15/25, 10:32 AM - R.M.: 
5/15/25, 10:32 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/15/25, 10:32 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/15/25, 10:32 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/15/25, 10:32 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/15/25, 10:32 AM - R.M.: These r all the pics i could take today
5/15/25, 10:33 AM - R.M.: For taking the entire pic from above,i need to climb the stairs... which i'll most probably in the evening <This message was edited>
5/15/25, 5:08 PM - Om Nunase: Damn that's impressive
5/15/25, 5:15 PM - R.M.: But what exactly is this plane used for?
5/15/25, 5:15 PM - R.M.: Why is it written navy??
5/15/25, 5:28 PM - R.M.: For this pics,I had to sacrifice so much sleep...had to get up at 8 today😭😭
5/15/25, 5:34 PM - Om Nunase: It must be an aircraft carrier aircraft
5/15/25, 5:34 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
5/15/25, 5:34 PM - Om Nunase: I got up at 7 after sleeping at 1 💀
5/15/25, 5:34 PM - Om Nunase: Sleeping is for babies
5/15/25, 5:36 PM - R.M.: So what is it doing at iitm?why did iitm get it and iitb got nothing
5/15/25, 5:37 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
5/15/25, 5:37 PM - R.M.: Yesterday i slept at 12:30 though 🥲
5/15/25, 5:38 PM - R.M.: But a min of 8 hrs sleep is needed for max productivity
5/15/25, 5:38 PM - Om Nunase: Forget sleep at IIT
5/15/25, 5:38 PM - R.M.: At iitb i usually Sleep till 12
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - Om Nunase: Courses?
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - R.M.: 5-12
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - R.M.: Very less sleep ig🤣🤣
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - Om Nunase: 💀💀💀
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - R.M.: Wdym??
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - R.M.: Maths, physics and dic
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - Om Nunase: Lectures?
5/15/25, 5:39 PM - R.M.: And dic i didn't study at all
5/15/25, 5:40 PM - Om Nunase: Am?
5/15/25, 5:40 PM - R.M.: We had it frm 2-5
5/15/25, 5:40 PM - R.M.: Yeah
5/15/25, 5:41 PM - R.M.: And ms lab in the morning
5/15/25, 5:41 PM - R.M.: So most of the time I used to sleep in lab
5/15/25, 5:42 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
5/15/25, 5:42 PM - R.M.: Sleep is the best thing in the world... better than aero I feel🥲
5/15/25, 5:46 PM - R.M.: Also that's different...u had a proper place for sleeping unlike me😭
5/15/25, 6:18 PM - Om Nunase: Where are you though
5/15/25, 6:30 PM - R.M.: Sabarmati hostel
5/15/25, 6:30 PM - R.M.: But since interns rnt given single rooms,so i prefer to stay in the Waiting room
5/15/25, 6:31 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/15/25, 6:32 PM - R.M.: I mean sharing room with PhD ppl is something that's not acceptable at all...😡
5/15/25, 6:45 PM - Om Nunase: 🥺
5/15/25, 6:46 PM - Om Nunase: Waiting room?
5/15/25, 7:05 PM - R.M.: Yeah
5/15/25, 7:06 PM - R.M.: But actually it's super cozy
5/15/25, 8:10 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/15/25, 8:30 PM - Om Nunase: 💀💀💀💀💀
5/15/25, 8:44 PM - Om Nunase: Are there any seniors from iitb there?
5/15/25, 9:19 PM - R.M.: Most ppl here r masters and PhD...so i didn't ask their college,bcoz anyways their college doesn't really matter (as masters and PhD is very bad in India)
5/15/25, 9:20 PM - R.M.: And unluckily in my lab,I m the only intern so prof expects a lot from me 😭😭
5/15/25, 9:22 PM - R.M.: And honestly everything feels absurd,like prof feels rankine cycle might b important in future aero
5/15/25, 9:22 PM - Om Nunase: Isn't it?
5/15/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: So on top of gas cycle,otto and all have to study rankine as well😭😭
5/15/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: Idk... he's giving lot of stress on it though
5/15/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: 🫡
5/15/25, 9:24 PM - R.M.: Is it really important?
5/15/25, 9:25 PM - R.M.: I mean how can rankine me more important than gas cycle in aero?
5/15/25, 9:32 PM - Om Nunase: 😕
5/15/25, 9:32 PM - Om Nunase: No idea
5/15/25, 9:37 PM - R.M.: Maybe iitm aero is something completely different from common perceptions
5/15/25, 9:39 PM - R.M.: Or maybe everyone is trying to trick me😢
5/15/25, 10:18 PM - Om Nunase: What happened?
5/15/25, 10:22 PM - R.M.: What m I supposed to do with rankine?i mean it's ok,but why so much stress
5/15/25, 10:23 PM - R.M.: Even if it's the future of aero,how m I supposed to bring a change in the aero industry
5/15/25, 10:23 PM - R.M.: I m an idiot, literally nothing in world level😭
5/15/25, 10:28 PM - Om Nunase: Start a company
5/15/25, 10:31 PM - R.M.: Company dealing with engines using rankine cycle?
5/15/25, 11:46 PM - Om Nunase: Nooo
5/15/25, 11:46 PM - Om Nunase: Any aerospace thing
5/16/25, 12:01 AM - R.M.: But there's a problem in being an entrepreneur.Say after ur death,no one will remember u...but say Einstein, he's immortal
5/16/25, 12:01 AM - R.M.: So i personally feel developing something can bring u fame
5/16/25, 12:38 AM - Om Nunase: Well well well... Your company will still be there launching rockets. And I agree that equations will make you immortal, building aerospace related progresses the civilization
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - R.M.: Yeah but it's a bit luck based
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: Nah
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: Not completely
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: Depends on you
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - R.M.: Also aerospace is such a field that common ppl can't even afford
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - R.M.: So how can the civilization progress
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: There are investors
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - R.M.: I meant rockets and all
5/16/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: Spin off technologies. Search then
5/16/25, 12:42 AM - R.M.: So what... directly ppl can't know ur work,right
5/16/25, 12:42 AM - R.M.: Then how can u gain fame
5/16/25, 12:42 AM - R.M.: *especially after death
5/16/25, 12:42 AM - Om Nunase: Make something useful
5/16/25, 12:42 AM - Om Nunase: Leave behind a legacy
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - R.M.: But ppl won't understand a single thing
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - Om Nunase: An equation, a spacecraft, etc..
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - Om Nunase: Why
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - R.M.: I meant common ppl
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - Om Nunase: It doesn't have to be D2C company
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - Om Nunase: Or b2c
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - Om Nunase: You can do b2b
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - Om Nunase: Like making something for the air force
5/16/25, 12:43 AM - R.M.: Bcoz indian education is terrible
5/16/25, 12:44 AM - Om Nunase: There are people who complain and there are people who change the world <This message was edited>
5/16/25, 12:44 AM - R.M.: Ok,i get ur point...but say 100 years after ur death,do u think ppl will remember u
5/16/25, 12:44 AM - Om Nunase: Does that matter to you?
5/16/25, 12:44 AM - R.M.: Well u told me this earlier too🥲
5/16/25, 12:45 AM - R.M.: Honestly idk...i just don't want to waste life
5/16/25, 12:45 AM - Om Nunase: For sure
5/16/25, 12:45 AM - R.M.: Like leading a life of luxury and all, that's what I don't want at all
5/16/25, 12:45 AM - Om Nunase: Say you did something important
5/16/25, 12:46 AM - R.M.: Like most iitians
5/16/25, 12:46 AM - Om Nunase: You can have a million dollars and be a physicist at the same time
5/16/25, 12:46 AM - R.M.: That's different
5/16/25, 12:46 AM - Om Nunase: Have a growth mindset
5/16/25, 12:46 AM - R.M.: I was talking about placements
5/16/25, 12:47 AM - R.M.: So for that u need to work a lot, that's the difference between this and placements
5/16/25, 12:48 AM - R.M.: Wait first of all for this,a high iq is needed,which I m deficit in
5/16/25, 12:48 AM - R.M.: So 😭😭
5/17/25, 10:10 PM - R.M.: I thought about it deeply...maybe it's true currently the world needs aero practical applications more than new researches
5/17/25, 10:10 PM - R.M.: And the field which really needs new research is biomedical...
5/17/25, 10:11 PM - R.M.: U r confusing me even more... earlier I was confused between aero and astronautics.Now should I really think about biomedical?
5/17/25, 10:12 PM - R.M.: I mean the world really needs Alzheimer's medicine and other disease as well😭
5/17/25, 10:33 PM - Om Nunase: Well... Developments in Aerospace automatically translate into development in other fields
5/17/25, 10:35 PM - R.M.: How though? Alzheimer's is a genetical disease
5/17/25, 10:35 PM - R.M.: How can aero help?
5/17/25, 10:36 PM - Om Nunase: Aerospace demands high tech. This drives in investments. It produces out of the world equipments, techniques and results
5/17/25, 10:36 PM - Om Nunase: That infrastructure helps
5/17/25, 10:36 PM - Om Nunase: Also
5/17/25, 10:36 PM - Om Nunase: Micro gravity biomedical research
5/17/25, 10:37 PM - R.M.: U mean infrastructure for research?
5/17/25, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
5/17/25, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: Think about it
5/17/25, 10:37 PM - R.M.: Isn't the infrastructure for Alzheimer's already well developed?
5/17/25, 10:37 PM - Om Nunase: Apollo program produced a demand for microprocessors
5/17/25, 10:38 PM - R.M.: Nah,if I think even more... I'll have to drop out of college 😭
5/17/25, 10:38 PM - Om Nunase: We wouldn't be taking on this phone off it weren't for apollo
5/17/25, 10:38 PM - R.M.: But I m talking about Alzheimer's only
5/17/25, 10:39 PM - R.M.: Whole blood transfusion and all other techniques failed
5/17/25, 10:41 PM - R.M.: Yeah but say if u r planning to focus only on aero based research (and nothing else)...then ur knowledge will b limited
5/17/25, 10:41 PM - R.M.: How can u contribute to Alzheimer's then?
5/17/25, 10:41 PM - Om Nunase: Idk
5/17/25, 10:41 PM - Om Nunase: What would it take to solve it?
5/17/25, 10:42 PM - R.M.: Proper knowledge about human anatomy and biochemical
5/17/25, 10:42 PM - R.M.: Bcoz afaik Alzheimer's is bcoz of some genetical protein
5/17/25, 10:43 PM - R.M.: Though now scientists have found some association of bacteria
5/17/25, 10:46 PM - R.M.: Ohh wait,blood is laminar flow,right?and body works on thermodynamics...so aero might actually help
5/17/25, 10:48 PM - R.M.: Nice then,maybe I'll discuss it with prof
5/18/25, 12:05 AM - Om Nunase: 🙃
5/18/25, 3:53 AM - R.M.: Do u have labs on weekends as well or only weekdays?
5/18/25, 5:50 AM - Om Nunase: Only weekdays
5/18/25, 9:19 AM - R.M.: What exactly is ur internship? research based?or like company based?
5/18/25, 1:18 PM - Om Nunase: Research based
5/18/25, 1:18 PM - Om Nunase: I'm researching on re entry capsules
5/18/25, 1:26 PM - R.M.: Ohh nice
5/18/25, 1:27 PM - R.M.: So like ur immediate guide is PhD ppl?or who exactly?
5/18/25, 1:29 PM - R.M.: That means u r sure enough that u'll go for masters and PhD in astronautics??
5/18/25, 1:30 PM - R.M.: How could u decide so soon...I m stuck in this since class 9😢
5/18/25, 1:33 PM - Om Nunase: Isro scientist
5/18/25, 1:34 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah even I got to know that after seeing others in my dept. That I've decided this so early in life. I mean I had this passion for space and related stuff
5/18/25, 1:35 PM - R.M.: I asked immediate guide
5/18/25, 1:35 PM - R.M.: Not the one who's going to give lor
5/18/25, 1:35 PM - Om Nunase: I will dedicate my life towards making humans a multiplanetary civilization. I shall make a system to go and return from LEO easily, just like regular flights
5/18/25, 1:35 PM - R.M.: I also had passion for defence...but 😭😭
5/18/25, 1:35 PM - Om Nunase: Guide you mean who?
5/18/25, 1:35 PM - Om Nunase: ...
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: Like who u can contact whenever u feel like
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: Regarding doubts and all
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: 24/7
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - Om Nunase: Ah
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - Om Nunase: I want one
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - Om Nunase: Tbh
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: Nice...can I b ur first passenger 🥲
5/18/25, 1:36 PM - Om Nunase: Sure
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: So like u r planning to join nasa?
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - Om Nunase: Nah that's too slow for me
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: Then?
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - Om Nunase: The whole process
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - Om Nunase: It's faster to start a company
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - Om Nunase: Than becoming a citizen
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: First of all u'll b doing a PhD right?
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: Of America?
5/18/25, 1:37 PM - Om Nunase: For fun yes
5/18/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: Post doc?
5/18/25, 1:38 PM - Om Nunase: Most probably no
5/18/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: Everything in propulsion only??
5/18/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: Astronautics propulsion?
5/18/25, 1:39 PM - R.M.: I too wanted to research on defence,but then America won't accept me😭
5/18/25, 1:39 PM - Om Nunase: Well you got to find other ways then right?
5/18/25, 1:40 PM - R.M.: Haa that's what I m saying na... that's why I m not sure what to do in future
5/18/25, 1:40 PM - Om Nunase: Start a company
5/18/25, 1:40 PM - R.M.: Then will u buy defense things from me??😅
5/18/25, 1:40 PM - Om Nunase: If you succeed, great 
If you fail, you have got some experience in the industry. Some connections, etc..

5/18/25, 1:41 PM - Om Nunase: You know ideaforge?
5/18/25, 1:41 PM - Om Nunase: It started here only at iit
5/18/25, 1:41 PM - Om Nunase: Iitb
5/18/25, 1:41 PM - R.M.: Why will they take from me?
5/18/25, 1:41 PM - R.M.: American is needed
5/18/25, 1:41 PM - Om Nunase: Prove them
5/18/25, 1:41 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - R.M.: It doesn't work for defence in america like that
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - R.M.: U need to b born an American
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - Om Nunase: Indian armed forces want indigenous products that work great
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - Om Nunase: I'm talking about indian armed forces
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - Om Nunase: In the beginning
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - R.M.: Ohh
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - Om Nunase: You can expand
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - Om Nunase: After you've established
5/18/25, 1:42 PM - Om Nunase: I heard ideaforge is also selling their products to other armies
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - Om Nunase: So it's possible
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - R.M.: American?
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - R.M.: Or Pakistan??
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - Om Nunase: Read
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - Om Nunase: Afaik south africa
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - R.M.: Fine... actually that's a nice idea...I can trying selling to Pakistan
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - Om Nunase: 🤨
5/18/25, 1:43 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
5/18/25, 1:44 PM - R.M.: Since their force is very weak,they might actually rely
5/18/25, 1:44 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/18/25, 1:44 PM - R.M.: 🤣🤣
5/18/25, 1:45 PM - Om Nunase: You scare me
5/18/25, 1:45 PM - R.M.: Or maybe I have a better idea...if I m a trained spacecraft pilot,will u let me fly ur vehicle?
5/18/25, 1:45 PM - Om Nunase: ...
5/18/25, 1:45 PM - Om Nunase: If it were manned
5/18/25, 1:45 PM - R.M.: Come on...that was just a joke...I m not that anti nationalist🤣
5/18/25, 1:45 PM - Om Nunase: I wanna become an astronaut too
5/18/25, 1:46 PM - R.M.: Ohh same here
5/18/25, 1:46 PM - Om Nunase: Or are you?
5/18/25, 1:46 PM - R.M.: Noooo...
5/18/25, 1:46 PM - R.M.: I mean I m neutral towards India
5/18/25, 1:46 PM - R.M.: I neither want it's growth nor failure
5/18/25, 1:47 PM - R.M.: So u r going for fighter plane training?
5/18/25, 1:47 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe
5/18/25, 1:47 PM - R.M.: But I can't even ride a cycle properly 😭
5/18/25, 1:48 PM - R.M.: Also u didn't have to tell this... that's quite obvious
5/18/25, 1:48 PM - Om Nunase: Will you be using that to go to space?
5/18/25, 1:48 PM - R.M.: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/18/25, 1:49 PM - R.M.: Lol even the idea is so funny😅
5/18/25, 1:49 PM - Om Nunase: 😂😂
5/18/25, 1:49 PM - R.M.: Btw,only 0.5 gb net is left.So I need to go offline asap
5/18/25, 1:49 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/18/25, 1:49 PM - Om Nunase: Loll
5/18/25, 1:50 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah sure. You need it there
5/18/25, 1:50 PM - R.M.: Yeah,I need to study so many things.That's why net gets used up fast😭
5/18/25, 1:50 PM - R.M.: Do u get free wifi there?
5/18/25, 1:50 PM - Om Nunase: Use data saver
5/18/25, 1:50 PM - Om Nunase: Noo 🥲
5/18/25, 1:50 PM - R.M.: Nah...best is to switch off phone
5/18/25, 1:51 PM - Om Nunase: 🙃
5/18/25, 1:51 PM - Om Nunase: Chal bye
5/18/25, 1:51 PM - R.M.: So,bye bye
5/18/25, 6:28 PM - R.M.: Seeing ur passion and dedication,I really feel there's a high chance of success.So,like after u succeed,suppose if we meet someday,what should I call u?by name or sir?
5/18/25, 6:48 PM - Om Nunase: Name
5/18/25, 7:27 PM - R.M.: Only if that's ok with u🥲
5/18/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/18/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
5/18/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: Lemme succeed first
5/18/25, 8:29 PM - R.M.: U know why most ppl don't succeed... it's bcoz the fire inside them dies after a certain age
5/18/25, 8:30 PM - R.M.: I don't believe luck plays a huge role here
5/18/25, 8:35 PM - Om Nunase: Exactly 💯
5/18/25, 8:41 PM - R.M.: Finally someone agreed with me...ppl usually call me crazy whenever I tell them all these 🥲
5/18/25, 8:41 PM - R.M.: Sadly,I m not even able to convince my sister 😭
5/18/25, 8:43 PM - Om Nunase: That's sad
5/18/25, 8:43 PM - Om Nunase: Why 🤌🏻
5/18/25, 8:44 PM - R.M.: Bcoz they think success is leading a happy life with lots of money
5/18/25, 8:44 PM - R.M.: And not working
5/18/25, 8:45 PM - R.M.: Endlessly...they feel all these to b like gamble
5/18/25, 8:45 PM - Om Nunase: Well.. it depends on how you define it
5/18/25, 8:46 PM - R.M.: Noooo
5/18/25, 8:46 PM - R.M.: How can u call this success
5/18/25, 8:46 PM - R.M.: Even an mr might have a lot of money
5/18/25, 8:47 PM - R.M.: By mr I meant medical representative
5/18/25, 8:47 PM - Om Nunase: Well that depends person to person right?
5/18/25, 8:47 PM - R.M.: Yeah,bit what gives them the right to call me unrealistic and crazy😭
5/18/25, 8:47 PM - Om Nunase: No one
5/18/25, 8:48 PM - R.M.: And for sista it's different...I have been trying my best to instill a spirit of research in her,but don't know why she wants an easy life😭
5/18/25, 8:48 PM - Om Nunase: 😕
5/18/25, 8:49 PM - Om Nunase: Isn't scientific curiosity something that comes from inside?
5/18/25, 8:49 PM - R.M.: Btw, r u done with report?
5/18/25, 8:49 PM - R.M.: Yeah obviously
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - R.M.: But actually I can't tolerate the fact that she wants a placement life😭
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - Om Nunase: Which report?
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - R.M.: Accha u don't have to submit a report?
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - R.M.: Iitm is so strict 😭
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - Om Nunase: 😐
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - R.M.: Proper research based culture 😭😭
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - R.M.: Or maybe they'll ask u at the end
5/18/25, 8:50 PM - Om Nunase: You should be happy right?
5/18/25, 8:51 PM - R.M.: And that's even worse🤣
5/18/25, 8:51 PM - R.M.: Yes and no...I mean since they expect a lot,maybe they'll supervise a lot for lor😭
5/18/25, 8:52 PM - R.M.: That means difficult to get a good lor ig😭
5/18/25, 8:53 PM - R.M.: Oh wait...I thought about it...I m not happy at iitm actually
5/18/25, 8:53 PM - Om Nunase: Huhhhhhhh
5/18/25, 8:54 PM - R.M.: Bcoz everything is so nice here...maybe I'll gain a lot of weight once I return+skin tan+missing college once I go back
5/18/25, 8:54 PM - R.M.: Literally the best place ever
5/18/25, 8:54 PM - R.M.: Better than home, better than iitb
5/18/25, 8:55 PM - Om Nunase: Here I am, unable to gain weight
5/18/25, 8:56 PM - R.M.: That's why u r lucky na...I have to have a calories count before I eat anything... depressing life
5/18/25, 8:57 PM - R.M.: And most importantly... missing furries😢
5/18/25, 8:59 PM - Om Nunase: Damn
5/18/25, 8:59 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/18/25, 9:27 PM - R.M.: Wait... just a minute,if u don't have report,then how do they supervise?then do they ask summary? or is ISRO that chill?
5/18/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: Chill
5/18/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: Pretty
5/18/25, 9:29 PM - R.M.: That's so unfair 😭
5/18/25, 9:29 PM - R.M.: First of all in iitm btech students r not selected,on top of that this...
5/18/25, 9:30 PM - R.M.: Is that why u chose ISRO over iitm
5/18/25, 9:30 PM - R.M.: ? <This message was edited>
5/18/25, 9:31 PM - Om Nunase: That makes you special, right?
5/18/25, 9:31 PM - Om Nunase: I didn't know
5/18/25, 9:32 PM - R.M.: Yeah,I think since iitm is research oriented,btech students don't apply
5/18/25, 9:33 PM - R.M.: Bcoz what else can b the reason of no btech?
5/18/25, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm
5/18/25, 9:33 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe
5/18/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: Then why didn't u choose IISC?
5/18/25, 9:35 PM - R.M.: Not really... everyone here is a senior...no one of the same age range 😢
5/18/25, 9:57 PM - Om Nunase: You should feel proud
5/18/25, 11:14 PM - R.M.: I'll feel proud when the world calls me ma'am and when I'll b portrayed on screens
5/18/25, 11:14 PM - R.M.: Not before that
5/18/25, 11:15 PM - Om Nunase: Great
5/18/25, 11:15 PM - R.M.: That's obvious though 🤣
5/18/25, 11:15 PM - R.M.: I mean that's why humans r born
5/18/25, 11:16 PM - Om Nunase: Uhh.. there was no media fame. You were famous if you killed a large animal back then
5/18/25, 11:16 PM - R.M.: Ohh come on...I meant something like Divya
5/18/25, 11:16 PM - Om Nunase: Ik
5/18/25, 11:16 PM - R.M.: Not famous in that way
5/18/25, 11:17 PM - Om Nunase: Joking
5/18/25, 11:17 PM - R.M.: But since it's very difficult,so I aim for fame after death 🥲
5/18/25, 11:17 PM - R.M.: Yeah got it
5/18/25, 11:17 PM - R.M.: Just like Kalpana 🥲
5/18/25, 11:18 PM - Om Nunase: ...
5/18/25, 11:19 PM - R.M.: And that fame is slightly luck I uld say
5/18/25, 11:21 PM - Om Nunase: Bad luck
5/18/25, 11:24 PM - R.M.: What?? it's the best luck anyone could ever have
5/18/25, 11:25 PM - Om Nunase: I meant the crash
5/18/25, 11:25 PM - R.M.: Just imagine as long as the world exists, everyone will remember u
5/18/25, 11:25 PM - R.M.: Haan actually I want something like that
5/18/25, 11:25 PM - R.M.: That was the best luck someone can actually have
5/18/25, 11:27 PM - Om Nunase: That won't happen in my spaceships
5/18/25, 11:55 PM - R.M.: Atleast u can make one specially designed for me... I'll really b thankful to u after death🥲
5/19/25, 12:12 AM - Om Nunase: ☠️☠️☠️
5/19/25, 12:30 AM - R.M.: Fine then,so it's a deal na?
5/19/25, 12:30 AM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/19/25, 12:30 AM - Om Nunase: Bruh
5/19/25, 12:31 AM - R.M.: I have been waiting for this since so long... that's the only fuel of my living now
5/19/25, 12:32 AM - R.M.: If not this,then teach me aerospace...so that I gain fame in Divya's way
5/19/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: Sure
5/19/25, 12:41 AM - Om Nunase: ...
5/21/25, 8:55 PM - R.M.: There was some rocket launch na today from veli or somewhere?how did it go?
5/21/25, 8:59 PM - Om Nunase: Yes yes
5/21/25, 8:59 PM - Om Nunase: Up
5/21/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: 🤣...say have u ever seen a rocket going down🤣
5/21/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: I hope I don't
5/21/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: Sounding rocket. I saw that 🥹
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - R.M.: Better state the  mathematical equation of the trajectory 🤣
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: A bit slanted
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: Straight
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - R.M.: Limit tends to 0?
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe like 80 degrees or so
5/21/25, 9:02 PM - R.M.: Ohh
5/21/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/21/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: Who knows... actually that could get u fame🥲
5/21/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: 💀 that implies a missile incoming
5/21/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: Why r u sending me a very blurred picture 😭😭
5/21/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: Yeah recently I discovered ramjet,turbo engines r also very interesting
5/21/25, 9:05 PM - R.M.: Yup...start a company on missile🥲
5/21/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/21/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: Morality
5/21/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: Goes away when you get funding for your defence startup
5/21/25, 9:07 PM - R.M.: Help destroy afghanistan
5/21/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/21/25, 9:08 PM - R.M.: And india too
5/21/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: 😑
5/21/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/21/25, 9:08 PM - R.M.: Then why did u tell me to go for defence startups...u want me to b immoral🤣
5/21/25, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/21/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Yeah ppl in Afghanistan r literally like this
5/21/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Uhh soooo cute 🥰🥰🥰
5/21/25, 9:10 PM - R.M.: Wait...so u mean my cat is going to kill me in future 😭😭
5/21/25, 9:12 PM - Om Nunase: Noo
5/21/25, 9:12 PM - Om Nunase: But she may do this...
5/21/25, 9:12 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/21/25, 9:13 PM - R.M.: Cutie❤️
5/21/25, 9:13 PM - R.M.: Fine atleast I don't have to worry about my male cat then🤣
5/21/25, 9:14 PM - Om Nunase: "dunga"
5/21/25, 9:14 PM - R.M.: Fine
5/21/25, 9:14 PM - R.M.: This is the best death one could ever expect
5/21/25, 9:14 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/21/25, 9:15 PM - R.M.: Being dead in the hands of someone who u care for 24/7 and love deeply😢
5/21/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: Worst
5/21/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: Haan...That was actually a sarcasm 🥲
5/21/25, 9:26 PM - R.M.: Wait...it actually has a very deep meaning...it means u can trust no one,most ppl r going to backstab u😢
5/22/25, 2:32 AM - R.M.: Wait...did they provide this research paper or whatever this is??
5/22/25, 7:31 AM - Om Nunase: No this is the book for next semester
5/22/25, 8:18 AM - R.M.: And what book do u have for thermo course?
5/22/25, 8:19 AM - Om Nunase: I referred farokhi
5/22/25, 8:27 AM - R.M.: How is it?
5/22/25, 3:56 PM - Om Nunase: Good
5/22/25, 3:56 PM - Om Nunase: Prof AM Pradeep himself recommended it so..
5/22/25, 4:17 PM - R.M.: Which course?AE(?)
5/22/25, 4:31 PM - Om Nunase: Thermodynamics and Propulsion
5/22/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: Nah i meant course number
5/22/25, 4:33 PM - Om Nunase: I forgot
5/22/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: And how was this prof?like did he explain everything very well?
5/22/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: And how was the grading?
5/22/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: Ok...like frankly speaking,how to get a cpi of 9.5+ in aero
5/22/25, 4:57 PM - Om Nunase: I got bad
5/22/25, 4:57 PM - Om Nunase: He's the HOD!
5/22/25, 4:57 PM - Om Nunase: Expert in gas turbines
5/22/25, 4:58 PM - Om Nunase: I don't have 😕
5/22/25, 4:58 PM - R.M.: Like in general
5/22/25, 4:58 PM - R.M.: So is the grading very strict??
5/22/25, 4:59 PM - R.M.: Damn!!that means he's old... implies grading is supposed to be very strict
5/22/25, 6:48 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
5/23/25, 1:52 PM - R.M.: So like what exactly r they teaching u?like theoretical knowledge of reusable rockets or like r u supposed to build some parts of rocket?
5/23/25, 5:45 PM - Om Nunase: I'm doing CFD
5/23/25, 6:42 PM - R.M.: But afaik it involves a strong background in coding,right?
5/23/25, 6:43 PM - R.M.: Though it has one of the best scopes for research
5/23/25, 7:06 PM - Om Nunase: Not strong
5/23/25, 7:18 PM - R.M.: Still u need to have a slight knowledge, right
5/23/25, 7:19 PM - R.M.: Like u can't avoid
5/23/25, 7:19 PM - Om Nunase: Ha i have
5/23/25, 7:19 PM - R.M.: I was trying to avoid coding...now prof told to submit a report including simulations in python or anything i feel like😭
5/23/25, 7:20 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
5/23/25, 7:20 PM - Om Nunase: Of course
5/23/25, 7:20 PM - Om Nunase: Python is very useful <This message was edited>
5/23/25, 7:20 PM - Om Nunase: In scientific community <This message was edited>
5/23/25, 7:21 PM - R.M.: Idk... actually I m trying my best to avoid it.Looking for better simulation softwares
5/23/25, 7:21 PM - Om Nunase: Why!
5/23/25, 7:21 PM - Om Nunase: You can't
5/23/25, 7:21 PM - R.M.: Bcoz how m I supposed to learn it in such a less time
5/23/25, 7:21 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Then just do it
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: It's easy
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - R.M.: +everyday i need to go through research papers
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Someone like me can learn it
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - R.M.: Honestly,I m not interested
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Why can't you
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Well well
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Even I wasn't
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - R.M.: Huh?u mean i m better than u🤣🤣
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: But then I got rejected from a prof project
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Because of this
5/23/25, 7:22 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe
5/23/25, 7:23 PM - R.M.: U could have used some other simulation alternatives
5/23/25, 7:23 PM - R.M.: U could have spoken to him once
5/23/25, 7:23 PM - Om Nunase: Nah
5/23/25, 7:23 PM - Om Nunase: It was an interview
5/23/25, 7:23 PM - Om Nunase: Python is 🛐
5/23/25, 7:23 PM - R.M.: Like I spoke to that prof
5/23/25, 7:24 PM - R.M.: He was telling the name of some other useful softwares,just went above my head
5/23/25, 7:24 PM - R.M.: Then he said python
5/23/25, 7:24 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
5/23/25, 7:24 PM - Om Nunase: And you died
5/23/25, 7:24 PM - R.M.: Nah i m still alive...still looking for alternative simulation softwares🤣
5/23/25, 7:25 PM - Om Nunase: You'll die in this pursuit. Better learn python
5/23/25, 7:25 PM - Om Nunase: Use Google colab
5/23/25, 7:25 PM - Om Nunase: Search this
5/23/25, 7:25 PM - Om Nunase: You'll get it
5/23/25, 7:25 PM - Om Nunase: It's very very easy once you understand
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: And dressing plots on python is fun
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - R.M.: But how come these things r needed in aero😭
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: Very fun
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: Well.... Because you don't want to have calculate or draw such plots
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: Do you want to go the era of slide rulers?
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - R.M.: But we need to code,right?
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: And drafting boards?
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: Start your coding journey on python
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - R.M.: Yup... only if I could 😭
5/23/25, 7:26 PM - Om Nunase: I did
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - Om Nunase: I did
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - R.M.: Actually I was looking for aero domains without coding
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - R.M.: But then I realised
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - R.M.: Everything needs coding 😭😭
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - Om Nunase: Doesn't exist
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - Om Nunase: There earlier you realise the better
5/23/25, 7:27 PM - R.M.: Yeah
5/23/25, 7:28 PM - R.M.: I realised it very well
5/23/25, 7:28 PM - R.M.: But thankfully the prof is in usa rn...this gives me time for simulation
5/23/25, 7:28 PM - Om Nunase: Name of prof?
5/23/25, 7:32 PM - R.M.: Amit Kumar
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - R.M.: Like I never coding was important in aero engines 😭
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - R.M.: Have to switch fields again ig😭
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: It is
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: No
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - R.M.: Means from propulsion to something else maybe
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠
5/23/25, 7:34 PM - Om Nunase: Come on
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - R.M.: Though I haven't yet decided to go for propulsion or aerod
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: Don't let this get in the way
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: You'll learn it
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: It's easy
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: I'm telling
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: Trust me
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - R.M.: Then u say which one should I take propulsion or aerod?
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - R.M.: Can't decide this yet😭
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: That's fine for now
5/23/25, 7:35 PM - Om Nunase: Propulsion requires aerodynamics also
5/23/25, 7:36 PM - R.M.: How is it fine...  i need to choose minors accordingly
5/23/25, 7:36 PM - Om Nunase: Compressible flows, etc
5/23/25, 7:36 PM - Om Nunase: 🤔
5/23/25, 7:36 PM - R.M.: There's this course... aircraft mechanics or spacecraft mechanics
5/23/25, 7:36 PM - R.M.: So now if I don't want aerod,I can take some other course
5/23/25, 7:37 PM - R.M.: It already affected in childhood...like I wanted to research on Alzheimer's,then again software is needed,so i dropped the idea😭
5/23/25, 7:38 PM - R.M.: That's chemical na?
5/23/25, 7:40 PM - R.M.: I mean it's a common course in chemical as well, afaik
5/23/25, 7:57 PM - R.M.: How long did it take for u to learn the basics?
5/23/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: Not much time. Half a day
5/23/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: What!! seriously??
5/23/25, 8:10 PM - R.M.: I mean java took me around a year to learn properly (In class 8)
5/23/25, 8:11 PM - R.M.: U had a strong coding experience prior to that?
5/23/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: Zero
5/23/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: Nowadays you have told like chatgpt
5/23/25, 8:20 PM - Om Nunase: Which can teach you
5/23/25, 8:24 PM - R.M.: Wdym?
5/23/25, 8:25 PM - R.M.: Didn't u have it in school?
5/23/25, 8:25 PM - Om Nunase: No
5/23/25, 8:30 PM - R.M.: Nice...icse is the worst board fr...cs was compulsory till class 10😭
5/23/25, 8:30 PM - Om Nunase: Well you don't know how privileged you were then
5/23/25, 8:30 PM - R.M.: Privileged??icse curriculum is really difficult
5/23/25, 8:31 PM - Om Nunase: Thinka bout this. In the whole of India, you got this internship, after so much efforts. Generally in first year nobody offers internship. You got this! And now you don't want to learn to code?
5/23/25, 8:31 PM - R.M.: +since I had a prior coding experience, won't feel like starting again...but since it's a new thing for u, maybe that's why u were enthusiastic
5/23/25, 8:32 PM - Om Nunase: Hard times make us tough
5/23/25, 8:32 PM - Om Nunase: Java is different
5/23/25, 8:32 PM - Om Nunase: Python is different
5/23/25, 8:32 PM - Om Nunase: Beginner friendly
5/23/25, 8:32 PM - R.M.: See the thing is that,once upon a time I had a grasp in cs... that's why I m not really that enthusiastic anymore
5/23/25, 8:32 PM - R.M.: Ohh
5/23/25, 8:33 PM - R.M.: Bluej is user friendly too
5/23/25, 8:33 PM - R.M.: Is it?no one in 1st year gets internship??
5/23/25, 8:33 PM - Om Nunase: No
5/23/25, 8:33 PM - Om Nunase: Very few
5/23/25, 8:34 PM - R.M.: Ohh ..maybe that's why there's no Freshie in this college
5/23/25, 8:39 PM - Om Nunase: Very important statistical inference you got now it seems
5/23/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: Thank u sir for making me realise this and importance of coding as well ❤️
5/23/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: 😅 you need not call me sir (even if I get knighthood)
5/23/25, 9:24 PM - R.M.: Lol ppl literally tell me to follow u🥲
5/23/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: Who..?
5/23/25, 9:24 PM - R.M.: Then what should I say?
5/23/25, 9:24 PM - R.M.: Lots of ppl who know u(maybe u don't know them)
5/23/25, 9:25 PM - Om Nunase: Huh? Really? Damn
5/23/25, 9:25 PM - Om Nunase: How many though. Just curious
5/23/25, 9:25 PM - R.M.: Yeah...not joking
5/23/25, 9:25 PM - R.M.: Wait lemme count
5/23/25, 9:26 PM - R.M.: 9 afai remember
5/23/25, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: 😳
5/23/25, 9:26 PM - R.M.: Well... partially it was my fault,hope u forgive me
5/23/25, 9:26 PM - Om Nunase: What fault?
5/23/25, 9:27 PM - R.M.: Maybe I praised a lot🥲
5/23/25, 9:27 PM - Om Nunase: 😅
5/23/25, 9:27 PM - Om Nunase: It's not a "fault"
5/23/25, 9:27 PM - Om Nunase: Lots of people say bad things about people behind their back. You didn't
5/23/25, 9:27 PM - R.M.: That's why I have to hear about u so many times a day...
5/23/25, 9:28 PM - R.M.: Why will I say bad things??
5/23/25, 9:28 PM - R.M.: Wait...wanna see a proof
5/23/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: 😳
5/23/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: I mean
5/23/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: Sure
5/23/25, 9:29 PM - Om Nunase: Not you..
5/23/25, 9:30 PM - R.M.: That's what I said... only if u do something bad then only can I say bad things.Else how can I?
5/23/25, 9:30 PM - R.M.: Gimme a min
5/23/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: Om is God he don't need no guides
5/23/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: Yea god always wants to help peasants
5/23/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: One of my friend wrote this about u...
5/23/25, 9:36 PM - R.M.: Though honestly I don't really like speaking bad about ppl(except Halloween)
5/23/25, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: Damn
5/23/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: I'm not
5/23/25, 9:42 PM - R.M.: Just tell that to him!!😭
5/23/25, 9:42 PM - R.M.: He tells me this almost everyday
5/23/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
5/23/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: Who is that guy
5/23/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: And my mom as well
5/23/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: U might not know him
5/23/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Parth
5/23/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Do u know him??
5/23/25, 9:43 PM - Om Nunase: No
5/23/25, 9:44 PM - R.M.: Yeah the next time u meet him,maybe tell him that and my mom too🤣
5/23/25, 9:44 PM - Om Nunase: 😅
5/23/25, 9:44 PM - Om Nunase: Wait what?
5/23/25, 9:45 PM - R.M.: Yeah she feels u r the best
5/23/25, 9:45 PM - R.M.: Well...maybe that's the impression they got from the way I portrayed u🥲
5/23/25, 9:46 PM - Om Nunase: Supporters are less initially. You seem one of them
5/23/25, 9:50 PM - R.M.: Initially??
5/23/25, 9:50 PM - R.M.: But rnt u the best?
5/23/25, 9:51 PM - R.M.: Doesn't everyone support you?
5/23/25, 9:51 PM - R.M.: *maybe if they don't, they'll lose out on something great
5/23/25, 9:53 PM - Om Nunase: Um no
5/23/25, 9:53 PM - R.M.: Then maybe they r fools🤣
5/23/25, 9:53 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - Om Nunase: Some of my classmates
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - R.M.: Ohh ur classmates r really fools
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - R.M.: Like I know some of them...
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - R.M.: Btw,will u forgive me for this?
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - Om Nunase: And one is in rakshak
5/23/25, 9:54 PM - R.M.: In case u got offended
5/23/25, 9:55 PM - Om Nunase: There's nothing to forgive
5/23/25, 9:55 PM - Om Nunase: I was surprised
5/23/25, 9:55 PM - R.M.: There's one in software na?
5/23/25, 9:55 PM - R.M.: So u'll hold this grudge forever 😭
5/23/25, 9:56 PM - Om Nunase: Huh😂
5/23/25, 9:56 PM - Om Nunase: Who?
5/23/25, 9:56 PM - Om Nunase: Lopa is a good friend
5/23/25, 9:57 PM - R.M.: Yeah and someone else too... can't remember her name rn
5/23/25, 9:57 PM - Om Nunase: Kashish
5/23/25, 9:57 PM - Om Nunase: Shreeram
5/23/25, 9:58 PM - R.M.: Ohh yeah
5/23/25, 9:58 PM - R.M.: Wait... he's ur batchmate?
5/23/25, 9:58 PM - R.M.: I thought he's ur senior
5/23/25, 9:58 PM - Om Nunase: Unfortunately yes
5/23/25, 9:58 PM - R.M.: She's a topper kind of person 😭
5/23/25, 9:58 PM - R.M.: She's also there in wncc,right? <This message was edited>
5/23/25, 9:59 PM - R.M.: Anyone else in rakshak who's ur batchmate?
5/23/25, 9:59 PM - Om Nunase: I think that's it
5/23/25, 10:01 PM - R.M.: Actually most of our  communication is subdivision wise only...so I don't really know ppl from other divisions 🥲
5/23/25, 10:01 PM - Om Nunase: Good
5/23/25, 10:01 PM - R.M.: And in aerod, from aerospace no sophie is there
5/23/25, 10:02 PM - R.M.: Till trying to find out the mystery!!
5/23/25, 10:02 PM - Om Nunase: That's weird
5/23/25, 10:02 PM - R.M.: Exactly...aerod with aerospace... mysterious!!
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - R.M.: Wait!!that reminds me...they gave us some summer  assignment...shit!! completely forgot about it
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: 💀💀💀
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - R.M.: So much work load😭😭
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: ☠️
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - R.M.: That's CFD though 🥲
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: Well
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: Ansys?
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - R.M.: Implies coding maybe😭
5/23/25, 10:03 PM - R.M.: Yeah
5/23/25, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: No
5/23/25, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: Abdur is gui based
5/23/25, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: Unless you want to automate
5/23/25, 10:04 PM - Om Nunase: Which you can do using scripts
5/23/25, 10:04 PM - R.M.: These guys...they just jump around...first xflr then ansys... without teaching anything properly 😢
5/23/25, 10:05 PM - Om Nunase: 🥲
5/23/25, 10:05 PM - R.M.: Maybe it's purposely...they want ppl to leave the team asap
5/23/25, 10:05 PM - Om Nunase: What else did they teach?
5/23/25, 10:05 PM - R.M.: Ohh i see
5/23/25, 10:05 PM - Om Nunase: Why? 😂
5/23/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: All sort of aerodynamics courses related to rakshak,xflr5,ansys,then dimension measurement in real life and making of balsa planes
5/23/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: So that their subdivision is small
5/23/25, 10:06 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm that's interesting
5/23/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: And they don't need to bond with many ppl
5/23/25, 10:07 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh 😂
5/23/25, 10:07 PM - R.M.: So that at the end of 4 years no one has to regret
5/23/25, 10:08 PM - R.M.: See actually I feel they want to win competitions like mechanics,not real life high understanding of things...
5/23/25, 10:08 PM - Om Nunase: 🥲 that's not what tech teams are supposed to do
5/23/25, 10:09 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe you could change that
5/23/25, 10:09 PM - R.M.: Idk...I just feel training could have been much better
5/23/25, 10:09 PM - R.M.: Obviously...if I m the subdivision lead🤣
5/23/25, 10:09 PM - R.M.: Btw,r u the next subdivision lead?
5/23/25, 10:10 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
5/23/25, 10:10 PM - Om Nunase: Got a lot to change
5/23/25, 10:10 PM - R.M.: Ohh nice...then train everyone properly
5/23/25, 10:10 PM - R.M.: Yeah obviously
5/23/25, 10:10 PM - R.M.: Or just kick them out...just what I m going to do if I m the subdivision lead🤣
5/23/25, 10:11 PM - Om Nunase: 😂😂
5/23/25, 10:11 PM - Om Nunase: Well
5/23/25, 10:11 PM - Om Nunase: Steve jobs you seem to be like
5/23/25, 10:12 PM - R.M.: Nah i meant as the lead u need to train everyone properly and if u find someone is not suitable or coming up with millions of excuses
5/23/25, 10:12 PM - R.M.: U should just kick them out
5/23/25, 10:12 PM - R.M.: *just like me
5/23/25, 10:12 PM - R.M.: Btw,can u pls answer one of my friend's question
5/23/25, 10:12 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
5/23/25, 10:13 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
5/23/25, 10:13 PM - R.M.: Answer this
5/23/25, 10:13 PM - R.M.: I m telling u this guy is just crazy about u🤣🤣
5/23/25, 10:13 PM - Om Nunase: Wth 😂😂😂
5/23/25, 10:14 PM - R.M.: Yoo what did he say?
5/23/25, 10:14 PM - R.M.: Will he also bless me??
5/23/25, 10:14 PM - R.M.: Answer
5/23/25, 10:14 PM - Om Nunase: I'm not a God, so no 😂
5/23/25, 10:15 PM - R.M.: Actually I felt our previous subdivision lead was too chill😭
5/23/25, 10:15 PM - R.M.: U might know him
5/23/25, 10:15 PM - R.M.: Do u?
5/23/25, 10:15 PM - Om Nunase: Who
5/23/25, 10:15 PM - R.M.: Vraj
5/23/25, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: I know him yes.
5/23/25, 10:16 PM - R.M.: Yeah...so he was very chill😭😭
5/23/25, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/23/25, 10:16 PM - R.M.: That's why sometimes I had to force freshies to come😢
5/23/25, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: 😲
5/23/25, 10:16 PM - Om Nunase: Junior team lead
5/23/25, 10:17 PM - R.M.: That's why I m saying u should b very strict
5/23/25, 10:17 PM - Om Nunase: I should find a middle ground I believe
5/23/25, 10:17 PM - R.M.: Else at the end of the day u'll b ruining ur own time
5/23/25, 10:17 PM - R.M.: Then no one will listen to u...
5/23/25, 10:17 PM - R.M.: That's the main problem
5/23/25, 10:17 PM - Om Nunase: 🫠🫠
5/23/25, 10:18 PM - R.M.: I believe being friendly out of the team and very strict in the team is what's needed
5/23/25, 10:18 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah exactly
5/23/25, 10:18 PM - Om Nunase: Not too strict
5/23/25, 10:19 PM - R.M.: Better... Start hitting ppl🤣
5/23/25, 10:19 PM - Om Nunase: Well... ☠️
5/23/25, 10:19 PM - Om Nunase: I think the work culture should be such that the person enjoys doing the work <This message was edited>
5/23/25, 10:19 PM - R.M.: But ig our next subdivision lead is a bit better
5/23/25, 10:19 PM - R.M.: See basically ppl join teams for one year and leave it
5/23/25, 10:20 PM - R.M.: They work only for por s
5/23/25, 10:20 PM - Om Nunase: Apparently yes
5/23/25, 10:20 PM - R.M.: But those who really want to learn, they'll learn no matter what
5/23/25, 10:20 PM - R.M.: Else like for example
5/23/25, 10:20 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
5/23/25, 10:20 PM - R.M.: Few days ago we had a subdivision meet and only 3 ppl joined
5/23/25, 10:21 PM - Om Nunase: 🙂
5/23/25, 10:21 PM - R.M.: Rest went on trips... nothing serious works😡
5/23/25, 10:21 PM - R.M.: Well ... something else for u
5/23/25, 10:21 PM - R.M.: The Man, The Myth, The Legend
5/23/25, 10:21 PM - Om Nunase: 😅
5/23/25, 10:22 PM - Om Nunase: Gotta prove this now
5/23/25, 10:22 PM - R.M.: Yeah...
5/23/25, 10:22 PM - R.M.: Wait btw,r u the team lead?
5/23/25, 10:23 PM - Om Nunase: Not yet
5/23/25, 10:23 PM - R.M.: Then u can change the work culture of the team as a whole
5/23/25, 10:23 PM - R.M.: Accha it's only for 4thies,right?
5/23/25, 10:23 PM - Om Nunase: 3rdies

5/24/25, 11:12 PM - R.M.: lol the last line says "individual as good as" implies personality and character. That's what I m asking: how to b like u characterwise ?

5/24/25, 11:18 PM - Om Nunase: Stand for a goal

5/24/25, 11:21 PM - R.M.: that's not what he's implying(maybe)😭
5/24/25, 11:21 PM - R.M.: he's basically asking me to walk in ur shoes
5/24/25, 11:22 PM - R.M.: like he feels the life u lead is the best
5/24/25, 11:22 PM - R.M.: not characterwise...like in general
5/24/25, 11:23 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
5/24/25, 11:23 PM - R.M.: what is this supposed to mean🥹

5/25/25, 12:04 AM - Om Nunase: I'm not enlightened
5/25/25, 12:04 AM - Om Nunase: Read Shrimad Bhagavad Gita
5/25/25, 12:17 AM - R.M.: plz don't tell me u read bhagvad gita … if that's the case, that  means I m really useless <This message was edited>

5/25/25, 4:21 PM - R.M.: That means I m a donkey 🥺
5/25/25, 4:21 PM - R.M.: Or maybe age factor...
5/25/25, 4:23 PM - Om Nunase: Nooo
5/25/25, 5:02 PM - R.M.: I really wanted enlightenment ... that's why I didn't suicide during that josaa depression 😢
5/25/25, 5:03 PM - R.M.: Else maybe I uld have been ur pet cat by now 😅
5/25/25, 7:56 PM - R.M.: Sorry if u were offended... actually that's how I talk when I m super excited 😭

5/25/25, 8:36 PM - Om Nunase: Damn. I don't know the difference
5/25/25, 8:47 PM - R.M.: Fair enough 😅
5/25/25, 8:49 PM - R.M.: Though kathakali is unique,i mean the costume looking like ghosts means kathakali 🤣

5/25/25, 11:25 PM - Om Nunase: Damn. You can see the sunrise, I can see the sunset
5/26/25, 12:03 AM - R.M.: I felt it basically means we r able to see our future only to a certain extent
5/26/25, 12:03 AM - R.M.: That doesn't mean it's the end...it still has a lot to go
5/26/25, 12:04 AM - R.M.: So whatever the circumstances r,we should never lose hope...even though sometimes we might think everything is over for us
5/26/25, 12:06 AM - R.M.: And clouds r congested near the crest,implies ppl will only b there during ur good times...after that they'll start thinning away...so we should never trust common ppl
5/26/25, 12:44 AM - R.M.: I don't get it.What sunrise and sunset r u talking about?
5/26/25, 12:50 AM - Om Nunase: You're on the east coast, I'm on the west coast

6/26/25, 3:08 PM - Om Nunase: Ask them how n2o goes into the engine
6/26/25, 3:08 PM - Om Nunase: What's used to ro control it
6/26/25, 3:12 PM - R.M.: As if they uld fall for it...after all they r IITians
6/26/25, 3:13 PM - R.M.: Like if someone asks me about balsa bcoz (s)he wants to make house...what will be my immediately reaction... contact a carpenter or architect 🤣
6/26/25, 3:14 PM - R.M.: Ohh well I get an idea
6/26/25, 3:15 PM - R.M.: I can fake my identity...as if I m studying dentistry 😭😭
6/26/25, 3:16 PM - R.M.: Is this valve for controlling nox content in engine?
6/26/25, 3:27 PM - Om Nunase: Ha
6/26/25, 3:28 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
6/26/25, 4:59 PM - R.M.: Ohh is this mechanism like:flow of oxidizer is controlled to adjust the equivalence ratio in such a way that nox emission is least??
6/26/25, 5:01 PM - R.M.: And the strain limit as well
6/26/25, 6:17 PM - Om Nunase: No we don't care about nox emissions
6/26/25, 7:08 PM - R.M.: Why not?
6/26/25, 7:09 PM - R.M.: Like for aviation, in some areas, research is going on in this part
6/26/25, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: Nah let the nox come out who cares
6/26/25, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: It's a small rocket anyway
6/26/25, 8:04 PM - Om Nunase: Transporting that rocket to USA will cause more nox emissions than the ticket itself
6/26/25, 8:12 PM - R.M.: But something great is developed by small problems only
6/26/25, 8:13 PM - R.M.: Like there's this startup at iitm, which was basically as a result of the problems faced by raftar
6/26/25, 8:13 PM - R.M.: Bcoz that's very harmful+flame if not taken care can lead to serious consequences of the engine
6/26/25, 10:44 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
6/26/25, 10:52 PM - R.M.: This happens at a very high mach number and an optimal angle of attack...lift>>>>>>drag <This message was edited>

7/26/25, 7:13 PM - Om Nunase: oh definitely not. you can hang outside locals without the fear of falling at great speeds and breaking you neck <This message was edited>

7/26/25, 7:18 PM - R.M.: Idk maybe it's bcoz of a slight bias,like I didn't find a single fault in chennai whereas i found everything nonsense in Bombay (nd I feel it's slightly associated to death)

8/4/25, 8:58 PM - Om Nunase: Idk
8/4/25, 8:58 PM - R.M.: Ikr...I kinda faced that in 1st year... even though it's India 😭
8/4/25, 8:58 PM - R.M.: So imagine how tough america is gonna be
8/4/25, 8:58 PM - Om Nunase: Also

8/4/25, 8:59 PM - R.M.: When r u giving though?

8/4/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: He worked on a CFD based research intern
8/4/25, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: Where
8/4/25, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: Univ?
8/4/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: When r u free?

8/4/25, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: That's univ
8/4/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: Hmm
8/4/25, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: JPL is nasa related
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: Classified stuff
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - R.M.: Why though?why do u wanna give me a treat?
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: Wait lemme see if I can apply
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: You don't want?
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: 🐈
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - R.M.: Hmm hmm...idt they'll let u without citizenship
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - R.M.: I want...but just that I was too shy to ask u for one🤣🤣
8/4/25, 9:01 PM - R.M.: 🐈
8/4/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: You're too shy
8/4/25, 9:02 PM - R.M.: But fine...u still have other universities open na... Georgia,texas, Pennsylvania
8/4/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: Acha right
8/4/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: I can apply to univ then
8/4/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm 🤔
8/4/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: For few things I m too shy and for few I m too Frank... extremist 😭
8/4/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/4/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: U can ask Vraj...he knows a lot about these stuffs
8/4/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: Bcoz today only he was telling me to apply for research intern in 3rd year
8/4/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: And yeah
8/4/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: He was telling me conferences as well... that's what prof rk pant said
8/4/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: I mean that can help u be a strong competitor
8/4/25, 9:05 PM - R.M.: Better is talk to him in details
8/4/25, 9:05 PM - R.M.: He knows a lot bcoz he's experienced 🐈🐈
8/4/25, 9:05 PM - Om Nunase: What
8/4/25, 9:06 PM - R.M.: And also see basically my chemical background will make me a strong competitor...unlike ppl from pure aero background
8/4/25, 9:06 PM - R.M.: So i can skip conferences <This message was edited>
8/4/25, 9:06 PM - R.M.: That how to use iitb resources for international conferences
8/4/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: Why though
8/4/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: Itar?
8/4/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Why what?
8/4/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Why using iitb resources?
8/4/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Or why I can portray myself as a strong competitor?
8/4/25, 9:10 PM - R.M.: Also yeah,vraj always emphasized on research intern...bcoz company intern can be a bit risky
8/4/25, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: Why risky?
8/4/25, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: Why not
8/4/25, 9:29 PM - R.M.: Matlab if u apply for masters or PhD in USA Universities
8/4/25, 9:29 PM - R.M.: Nd have a research intern, then u need other things properly sorted
8/4/25, 9:30 PM - R.M.: Like cpi, conferences, good recommendation,good slp and btp
8/4/25, 9:31 PM - R.M.: Bcoz company skills don't really align with reasearch field (especially PhD)
8/4/25, 9:31 PM - R.M.: So if in the same time u have a research intern, it'll make u b a strong competitor
8/4/25, 9:31 PM - Om Nunase: Acha
8/4/25, 9:31 PM - Om Nunase: 🐥
8/4/25, 9:31 PM - R.M.: +lor from foreign profs have a different value
8/4/25, 9:32 PM - R.M.: And especially if the prof is well renowned,then u r sorted out for life🐈
8/4/25, 9:33 PM - R.M.: That's bcoz I'll have a better sop+in propulsion part, I'll have an overall knowledge,while aero peeps will have just aero limited knowledge
8/4/25, 9:34 PM - R.M.: Just like I said earlier,I want a treat,but just that I was too shy🐈🐈
8/4/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: No I meant why won't I give
8/4/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm hmm
8/4/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: Why aren't you doing for the competition
8/4/25, 9:41 PM - R.M.: 🐈
8/4/25, 9:41 PM - R.M.: Wdym?what competition?
8/4/25, 9:41 PM - R.M.: Masters?
8/4/25, 9:42 PM - R.M.: I still have a looooooooooonnnnnnngggggggg time🐑
8/4/25, 10:12 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh. Rakshak
8/4/25, 10:12 PM - Om Nunase: *going
8/4/25, 10:22 PM - R.M.: See if I get an intern in 2nd year,why will i leave it for competition
8/4/25, 10:22 PM - R.M.: And competition is in July...peak time for intern
8/4/25, 10:23 PM - R.M.: I wanted to... bcoz a new country with team is something which I'll probably never experience...but yeah research intern has a different value for masters 🐈🐈 <This message was edited>
8/4/25, 10:24 PM - R.M.: But plz don't tell my teammates...bcoz they told us that peak working time is summer vacations 😭😭
8/4/25, 10:31 PM - Om Nunase: No i won't
8/4/25, 10:31 PM - Om Nunase: You can trust me
8/4/25, 10:38 PM - R.M.: Yeah i trust u, that's why I told u in the first place 🐈🐈

8/15/25, 11:13 AM - Om Nunase: Where?
8/15/25, 11:13 AM - Om Nunase: I'm down with cough
8/15/25, 11:14 AM - R.M.: Tl
8/15/25, 11:14 AM - R.M.: Me too😭😭...not cough,but feeling lethargic 🥲
8/15/25, 11:14 AM - R.M.: Still I came...u too come🐒
8/15/25, 11:16 AM - Om Nunase: Can't
8/15/25, 11:18 AM - R.M.: Nvm,I was just kidding...get well soon 🐱
8/15/25, 11:25 AM - R.M.: Accept the request 🐱 <This message was edited>
8/15/25, 11:27 AM - Om Nunase: Did
8/15/25, 11:28 AM - Om Nunase: Got it?
8/15/25, 11:32 AM - R.M.: yeah
8/15/25, 11:34 AM - R.M.: lmao will take time🐱
8/15/25, 11:35 AM - R.M.: also before editing
8/15/25, 11:35 AM - R.M.: we need to 1st decide on the wing
8/15/25, 11:36 AM - R.M.: i'll decide the final wing config and lyk
8/15/25, 11:36 AM - Om Nunase: Don't edit this code. Make a copy and edit that. It will be easier to work
8/15/25, 11:40 AM - R.M.: Yeah yeah I'll do that only
8/15/25, 2:36 PM - R.M.: What's the usual Reynolds number for it to fly?
8/15/25, 2:41 PM - Om Nunase: Calculate
8/15/25, 2:43 PM - Om Nunase: Velocity around 7-10 m/s
8/15/25, 2:43 PM - Om Nunase: Chord ranges from 10cm to 30 cm
8/15/25, 2:49 PM - R.M.: I m doing calculations for stratosphere only
8/15/25, 2:49 PM - R.M.: Reynolds number is coming out to b very low
8/15/25, 2:49 PM - R.M.: At such a low value, i don't think all airfoils will work
8/15/25, 2:53 PM - Om Nunase: Uhh
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - Om Nunase: First <This message was edited>
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - Om Nunase: Let's build the v1
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - R.M.: V1?
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - Om Nunase: Version 1
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - R.M.: I was analysing the foils
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - R.M.: Damn!!
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - R.M.: I analysed in stratosphere conditions
8/15/25, 2:54 PM - R.M.: So what altitude should this be?
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: I told you
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: Idhar hi udana hai
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: Gymhana
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - R.M.: That'll bring too much difference
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: Getting permissions is too much work
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - R.M.: Like the foils will change a lot
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - R.M.: Demo and real one
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: No worries
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - Om Nunase: It needs to fly
8/15/25, 2:55 PM - R.M.: So for the time being, I'll focus on 30 m?
8/15/25, 2:56 PM - R.M.: Troposphere foils
8/15/25, 2:56 PM - R.M.: Re around 5e4 to 2e5 (approx)
8/15/25, 2:56 PM - Om Nunase: Sure
8/15/25, 2:57 PM - R.M.: And the chord lengths u said, it's for the demo?
8/15/25, 2:57 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/15/25, 2:59 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 3:00 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 3:00 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 3:00 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 3:05 PM - R.M.: You deleted this message
8/15/25, 3:05 PM - R.M.: These r the dat files,u can analyse on ur own too🐒🐒
8/15/25, 3:20 PM - Om Nunase: 🐒
8/15/25, 3:20 PM - Om Nunase: Damn
8/15/25, 3:20 PM - Om Nunase: Tell me the conclusion
8/15/25, 3:38 PM - R.M.: Considering endurance as the prime factor,I feel ag24 is better
8/15/25, 3:39 PM - R.M.: Though s 1223 gives more lift
8/15/25, 3:39 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 3:40 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 3:45 PM - Om Nunase: So finally which airfoil
8/15/25, 4:03 PM - R.M.: Ag 24
8/15/25, 4:03 PM - R.M.: But with it some issues arise
8/15/25, 4:03 PM - Om Nunase: Silver 🌟
8/15/25, 4:03 PM - R.M.: Nvm,we just need to ensure stability
8/15/25, 4:03 PM - R.M.: If that's done,ag 24 is the best to go with...both for demo and stratosphere
8/15/25, 4:03 PM - R.M.: Why chemistry 😭😭
8/15/25, 4:04 PM - Om Nunase: Sorry
8/15/25, 4:04 PM - Om Nunase: Taper ratio 0.45 we'll keep
8/15/25, 4:04 PM - R.M.: 🐒🐒
8/15/25, 4:04 PM - R.M.: Why?
8/15/25, 4:04 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:05 PM - Om Nunase: Rectangular wing: 7% more drag than elliptical

Taper ratio 0.45 wing: 1% more drag than ellipse
8/15/25, 4:05 PM - R.M.: Then why not perfect ellipse?
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - R.M.: Ok fine got it
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm since we're 3d printing it
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - Om Nunase: But
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - R.M.: Difficult to build
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - Om Nunase: In main plane, it will be difficult to achieve
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - R.M.: R u sure about it?
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - Om Nunase: For v1, yes
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - R.M.: Like why not balsa?
8/15/25, 4:06 PM - R.M.: Balsa is a soft wood that gives too much structural stability
8/15/25, 4:07 PM - R.M.: Easy to mould and construct too
8/15/25, 4:07 PM - Om Nunase: 3d printing will give more accurate sirfoil shape than balsa
8/15/25, 4:07 PM - R.M.: But did u check the structural stability?
8/15/25, 4:07 PM - R.M.: Like will 3d print b able to tolerate the excessive stress?
8/15/25, 4:08 PM - R.M.: That might come from loading solar panels
8/15/25, 4:08 PM - Om Nunase: The stress bearing can be done by carbon fibre rods
8/15/25, 4:08 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:08 PM - R.M.: Then to many rods will b needed
8/15/25, 4:08 PM - R.M.: High cost🐒
8/15/25, 4:08 PM - Om Nunase: Let's print one airfoil after finalizing design and then decide
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: U wanna print today?
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: Balsa mein manual labour is high
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: So what?
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: Well we should finalise the config first
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: U can ask ayush for that🐒
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: Namely the sizes of wings, tails etf
8/15/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: He's ready for all labourer works🤣🤣🐱
8/15/25, 4:10 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:10 PM - R.M.: So is ag 24 confirmed?
8/15/25, 4:10 PM - R.M.: Aww after so long 😺😺
8/15/25, 4:10 PM - Om Nunase: Send ss of airfoil
8/15/25, 4:10 PM - R.M.: How to?
8/15/25, 4:11 PM - R.M.: I sent the dat file na
8/15/25, 4:11 PM - Om Nunase: Ss bhejo na I can't open my laptop
8/15/25, 4:11 PM - R.M.: Ss of dat file?or airfoil outline?
8/15/25, 4:11 PM - Om Nunase: Outline
8/15/25, 4:11 PM - Om Nunase: Lol
8/15/25, 4:11 PM - R.M.: Wait
8/15/25, 4:12 PM - Om Nunase: No
8/15/25, 4:12 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
8/15/25, 4:12 PM - R.M.: See for every projects,there r engineers who figure things out and labourers to carry that out...so yeah, recruit balsa labours🐱🐱
8/15/25, 4:14 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:15 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm cool
8/15/25, 4:15 PM - Om Nunase: I was just seeing if it's structurally sound or not, whether we can fit carbon rod in that or not
8/15/25, 4:15 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:16 PM - R.M.: So what do u think?
8/15/25, 4:16 PM - Om Nunase: Good. We can fit carbon rod at approx c/4
8/15/25, 4:16 PM - R.M.: Haan that's fine
8/15/25, 4:16 PM - Om Nunase: Where is it's centre of lift
8/15/25, 4:16 PM - R.M.: But I don't think 3d print will b a good idea
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: Let's see
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - R.M.: After long😺
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - R.M.: Hmm,lemme see
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: By long you mean two days
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: There the carbon rods will go
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - R.M.: Also why did u text in the group about it yesterday 😭😭
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: 🐒
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - R.M.: I was so embarrassed 😭
8/15/25, 4:17 PM - Om Nunase: 😺😺😺😺
8/15/25, 4:18 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:18 PM - R.M.: Which one r u?
8/15/25, 4:18 PM - R.M.: The cat?or the horse?
8/15/25, 4:18 PM - Om Nunase: Lol idk
8/15/25, 4:28 PM - R.M.: From calculations, it's around 7% for small aoa
8/15/25, 4:28 PM - R.M.: 😭😭
8/15/25, 4:28 PM - Om Nunase: 7% of the chord?
8/15/25, 4:28 PM - R.M.: Yup
8/15/25, 4:29 PM - Om Nunase: lol i thought 25% was a good approximation
8/15/25, 4:29 PM - R.M.: But it's not symmetrical na
8/15/25, 4:29 PM - Om Nunase: hmm
8/15/25, 4:29 PM - R.M.: Idt aerodynamic centre will coincide with col
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - Om Nunase: is it
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - Om Nunase: then fine
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: Especially in this unsymmetrical airfoil
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - Om Nunase: at the end, my rod should support the airfoil
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: It's very much unsymmetrical
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: Don't believe me😭
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: My knowledge is very limited 😭😭
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - Om Nunase: i believe you yrr
8/15/25, 4:30 PM - Om Nunase: bruh
8/15/25, 4:31 PM - R.M.: Then ur plane is gonna fly in downward direction 🐱🐱
8/15/25, 4:31 PM - R.M.: Ok fine, I'll try to code it for accurate results
8/15/25, 4:31 PM - Om Nunase: sahi hai
8/15/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: Bcoz u don't believe 7 percent
8/15/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: Neither do i
8/15/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: 🐱
8/15/25, 4:32 PM - Om Nunase: :)
8/15/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: But not now...bcoz i closed my laptop 🐒
8/15/25, 4:34 PM - R.M.: Like generally what do aeromodelling ppl do in case of unsymmetric airfoils?
8/15/25, 4:34 PM - R.M.: 25%?
8/15/25, 4:34 PM - Om Nunase: dont know
8/15/25, 4:35 PM - Om Nunase: ask ayush :)
8/15/25, 4:35 PM - R.M.: 🐒🐒
8/15/25, 4:35 PM - Om Nunase: 🐴

8/15/25, 4:37 PM - Om Nunase: did you see the burning of steel wool
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: Why did u say u won't gift me that?then no sheepy for u🐑
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: Yup
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - Om Nunase: its a dangerous material
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - Om Nunase: you want to be in danger?
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: Lol i was standing in front of urvi or whatever her name is🐒
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: Yeah,why not
8/15/25, 4:37 PM - Om Nunase: yeah urvi

8/15/25, 4:38 PM - R.M.: In the sense?
8/15/25, 4:38 PM - R.M.: It's just wool na
8/15/25, 4:38 PM - Om Nunase: combustible, plus its very fine
8/15/25, 4:38 PM - R.M.: Ohh 🐒
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - R.M.: It's like fine sheets of steel?
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - Om Nunase: not sheets
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - Om Nunase: strings
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - R.M.: Then?
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - R.M.: Ohh it felt like sheet though 🐑
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - Om Nunase: its not that steel wool used to wash utensils
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - Om Nunase: its very fine
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - R.M.: Utensils?
8/15/25, 4:39 PM - Om Nunase: food utensils
8/15/25, 4:40 PM - R.M.: Is wool used to wash utensils?
8/15/25, 4:40 PM - R.M.: Lol i know english 😭😭

8/15/25, 4:41 PM - R.M.: Didn't know that🐑
8/15/25, 4:41 PM - Om Nunase: apparently
8/15/25, 4:41 PM - R.M.: This baby is so cute na
8/15/25, 4:41 PM - R.M.: Yesterday the baby who came up was sooooooo soft 🥰
8/15/25, 4:41 PM - Om Nunase: human baby?
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - R.M.: Noooo...baby means kitty
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - Om Nunase: eat it
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - R.M.: I wanted to bite it
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - R.M.: But I didn't
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - Om Nunase: shouldve
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - R.M.: I just kissed it and let it go🐒
8/15/25, 4:42 PM - Om Nunase: hmm
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - R.M.: Yeah ...so soft🐑🐑
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - Om Nunase: cotton candy
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - R.M.: Softer than that
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - R.M.: If our drone succeeds
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - Om Nunase: damn
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - Om Nunase: no
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - Om Nunase: i know what youre typing
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - R.M.: I'll gift u a baby
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - R.M.: And u can't reject it
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - Om Nunase: oh lol
8/15/25, 4:43 PM - R.M.: What did u think?
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - Om Nunase: i thought you would type, if our drone succeeds, the kitty will be the payload
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: What about the ramjet though?
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: Nooooo
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: I can't lose kitty 😭
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - Om Nunase: imagine na
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - Om Nunase: none of his/her friends would believe
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: Stagnation point?
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: Who?
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - Om Nunase: kitty
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: Baby's friend?
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: Ohh
8/15/25, 4:44 PM - R.M.: Believe what?
8/15/25, 4:45 PM - Om Nunase: that she was flying
8/15/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: Yeah...🐒🐒
8/15/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: But how did u know baby is a girl?
8/15/25, 4:45 PM - Om Nunase: that he was flying
8/15/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: Nooooo...baby is actually a girl 🐱
8/15/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: that it was flying
8/15/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: Don't call her that... she's a hooman being after all😭
8/15/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: .
8/15/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: :)
8/15/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:47 PM - R.M.: Why didn't u consider my ideas😭
8/15/25, 4:47 PM - Om Nunase: which idea
8/15/25, 4:48 PM - R.M.: Baffle geometry 🐱
8/15/25, 4:48 PM - Om Nunase: lets see
8/15/25, 4:48 PM - R.M.: Like calculations of the radius of bluff bodies
8/15/25, 4:48 PM - R.M.: I m more curious about the ramjet than drone🐒🐒
8/15/25, 4:49 PM - R.M.: Bcoz that's what we do in tech team
8/15/25, 4:49 PM - R.M.: But ur tech team is more into engines,so...
8/15/25, 4:50 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/15/25, 4:51 PM - Om Nunase: im in sleeping position
8/15/25, 4:51 PM - R.M.: But but...
8/15/25, 4:52 PM - R.M.: Isn't it time to wake up🐱
8/15/25, 4:52 PM - R.M.: Why r u again copying me😭
8/15/25, 4:52 PM - Om Nunase: yeah but health
8/15/25, 4:52 PM - R.M.: Ohh is it that serious??r u feverish?
8/15/25, 4:52 PM - Om Nunase: why do you use this crying emoji so much 🤣🤣🤣
8/15/25, 4:52 PM - R.M.: I thought just a normal cold
8/15/25, 4:53 PM - Om Nunase: i dont feel like eating
8/15/25, 4:53 PM - R.M.: Not too much...I use meow emoji mainly

8/16/25, 1:15 AM - Om Nunase: you consider me special?
8/16/25, 1:15 AM - R.M.: U realised it now?
8/16/25, 1:15 AM - Om Nunase: nah but this much
8/16/25, 1:15 AM - R.M.: After all these months?
8/16/25, 1:16 AM - R.M.: Wasn't it evident
8/16/25, 1:16 AM - Om Nunase: 😭
8/16/25, 1:16 AM - Om Nunase: it was but i thought youre like this to everyone
8/16/25, 1:16 AM - R.M.: Lol what?!? damn!!each and every day lots of ppl think I m ignoring them

8/16/25, 1:26 AM - Om Nunase: 3rd time
8/16/25, 1:26 AM - R.M.: Meowye
8/16/25, 1:26 AM - R.M.: 2nd time
8/16/25, 1:26 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 1:42 AM - R.M.: SLEEP
8/16/25, 1:43 AM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 1:48 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:06 PM - R.M.: Uhh i calculated the col for diff angle of attacks... it's varying in a large range🐒🐒
8/16/25, 4:07 PM - Om Nunase: 🥲
8/16/25, 4:08 PM - R.M.: But why did u even ask for centre of lift?
8/16/25, 4:08 PM - R.M.: I mean it'll vary with angle of attack... isn't aerodynamic centre more realistic?
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: Idk
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: What's good for structures
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: Aerodynamic centre
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: Where should the rod be placed
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: Usually that's calculated for designing
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: I mean centre of lift is calculated
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - R.M.: But not as useful
8/16/25, 4:09 PM - Om Nunase: Acha
8/16/25, 4:10 PM - R.M.: So what should we do🐒
8/16/25, 4:11 PM - R.M.: Also I was going through ur code...where did u get the cl and cd values from 🐑
8/16/25, 4:11 PM - Om Nunase: 🐑
8/16/25, 4:11 PM - Om Nunase: That we have to input
8/16/25, 4:11 PM - Om Nunase: Those were just example values
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - R.M.: 😭😭
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - R.M.: Which airfoil did u use as example?
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - R.M.: Or just arbitrary values?
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - Om Nunase: It was just a guess
8/16/25, 4:12 PM - R.M.: Gemini guess?🐑🐑
8/16/25, 4:14 PM - R.M.: But cl and cd values depend on angle of attack...so it's varying in a large range
8/16/25, 4:15 PM - R.M.: Better is I'll send u a doc of all the values...u change them accordingly
8/16/25, 4:15 PM - R.M.: Bcoz i m not sure what exactly to change in the code
8/16/25, 4:15 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:19 PM - Om Nunase: It's for cruise
8/16/25, 4:35 PM - R.M.: 🐒🐑🐎🐥😺🐱🦥🐈

8/16/25, 4:52 PM - R.M.: But don't trust me🐑🐑

8/16/25, 4:53 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:53 PM - Om Nunase: Maybe it's time to check past data is actual planes
8/16/25, 4:53 PM - Om Nunase: See
8/16/25, 4:53 PM - R.M.: No
8/16/25, 4:53 PM - Om Nunase: Our plane is basically like a sailplane
8/16/25, 4:53 PM - R.M.: So what... isn't ag 24 suitable for that
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - Om Nunase: Idk
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: Calculations showed that
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: Since u don't believe me
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - Om Nunase: I do
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: I even sent u the files🐑🐑
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: U can check it on ur own 🐒
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - Om Nunase: When did j say I dont 🥲
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: .
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - Om Nunase: I'm too lazy for that 🍙
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: That's why I said na
8/16/25, 4:54 PM - R.M.: I checked it
8/16/25, 4:55 PM - R.M.: See the graph i sent 🐒
8/16/25, 4:55 PM - Om Nunase: I'm not in the mood 🐈
8/16/25, 4:56 PM - R.M.: Nvm...I checked it
8/16/25, 4:57 PM - R.M.: It said for some sailplanes ag is used
8/16/25, 4:57 PM - R.M.: And other foils too
8/16/25, 4:57 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:57 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 4:57 PM - R.M.: That's why I checked multiple foils
8/16/25, 4:57 PM - R.M.: But I feel ag 24 gave the best results
8/16/25, 4:58 PM - R.M.: This tent is soooo cute...like kitty 🐒
8/16/25, 4:58 PM - R.M.: But again for stratospheric plane, values might change
8/16/25, 4:59 PM - R.M.: My simulation was for demo only 🐒🐒
8/16/25, 4:59 PM - Om Nunase: It's not a tent it's a rice ball 🍙😭
8/16/25, 4:59 PM - Om Nunase: Agreed
8/16/25, 4:59 PM - R.M.: But black door in front of rice🦥
8/16/25, 5:00 PM - R.M.: It can b done afterwards...but for demo ah 24 gave better results
8/16/25, 5:00 PM - Om Nunase: Sure

8/16/25, 5:03 PM - Om Nunase: 😁
8/16/25, 5:03 PM - R.M.: I hope this doesn't happen... suppose if the plane doesn't fly,and we blame each other 🤣
8/16/25, 5:04 PM - Om Nunase: 🐑
8/16/25, 5:04 PM - R.M.: No one to blame the other 2 ppl,bcoz they r in different subdivision... comparatively easier subdivisions 🐒🐒
8/16/25, 5:04 PM - Om Nunase: 🥲
8/16/25, 5:04 PM - Om Nunase: That's not easy tbh
8/16/25, 5:05 PM - R.M.: Ohh i didn't know that🐒

8/16/25, 7:49 PM - R.M.: Btw
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - R.M.: Ur friend again came to our wing 🤣🤣
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - Om Nunase: Dev
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - R.M.: Yesterday too he came
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - R.M.: Hmm
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - R.M.: What's so special about our wing 😭😭
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - R.M.: Lol yeah 🤣🤣
8/16/25, 7:49 PM - Om Nunase: Durva
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - R.M.: Lol no...she is not in room
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - R.M.: She went for some dance performance
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - R.M.: Most of the time she isn't there
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - R.M.: For dance
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - R.M.: Ayushi ig...
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - R.M.: M not sure though 🐒🐒
8/16/25, 7:50 PM - Om Nunase: Hmm hmm
8/16/25, 7:51 PM - R.M.: Still ... coming everyday means walking so far makes no sense 🐑🐑
8/16/25, 7:51 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:51 PM - Om Nunase: 🐈
8/16/25, 7:52 PM - R.M.: Which one r u?
8/16/25, 7:52 PM - Om Nunase: Black one
8/16/25, 7:52 PM - Om Nunase: Orange ones are more notorious
8/16/25, 7:52 PM - R.M.: So u pushed me😭😭
8/16/25, 7:53 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
8/16/25, 7:53 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:53 PM - R.M.: Noooooo ...they r more dramatic
8/16/25, 7:53 PM - Om Nunase: ~Like u?~
8/16/25, 7:53 PM - R.M.: U called me dramatic 😭
8/16/25, 7:53 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - Om Nunase: Aren't you
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - Om Nunase: Good question
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - Om Nunase: Done?
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - R.M.: So that's what u think about me😭
8/16/25, 7:54 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: According to the stickers you send
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - R.M.: Ok fine
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - R.M.: I get it
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: 🐑
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - R.M.: I won't send any more stickers
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: 😭😭😭
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: Nooo
8/16/25, 7:55 PM - Om Nunase: Dramatic ≠ bad
8/16/25, 7:56 PM - R.M.: Yeah it is... dramatic=someone who is the least important
8/16/25, 7:56 PM - Om Nunase: 😭 noo
8/16/25, 7:56 PM - R.M.: Someone who has no value
8/16/25, 7:57 PM - Om Nunase: You're taking it negatively 😭
8/16/25, 7:57 PM - R.M.: Then what exactly do u mean by dramatic?
8/16/25, 7:57 PM - Om Nunase: Funny
8/16/25, 7:57 PM - R.M.: So i m funny?
8/16/25, 7:57 PM - R.M.: Like a clown?
8/16/25, 7:57 PM - Om Nunase: 😭
8/16/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: Clown=no value
8/16/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: Nvm,I get it what u mean
8/16/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: I was just playing along 🐑
8/16/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: See u r also being meowatic🤣
8/16/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: I knew that
8/16/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: Meowwww
8/16/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: Why r u beating me?
8/16/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: 😭
8/16/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: Life is an illusion maybe
8/16/25, 8:00 PM - Om Nunase: Who knows
8/16/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: Somewhere between existence and non existence
8/16/25, 8:01 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:03 PM - R.M.: Btw,how far is the project going on?
8/16/25, 8:03 PM - R.M.: R the other 2 ppl 's work done?
8/16/25, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: No
8/16/25, 8:03 PM - Om Nunase: We have to give them a config
8/16/25, 8:04 PM - R.M.: Why?
8/16/25, 8:04 PM - R.M.: Can't they generalize
8/16/25, 8:04 PM - Om Nunase: We're the aircraft designers
8/16/25, 8:04 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:04 PM - R.M.: I meant can't they generalize the power and all needed usually for sailplanes
8/16/25, 8:04 PM - R.M.: And write a code
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: Then we can upload our values and get the final result
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: We should be doing that naa
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: Code for solar power?
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: By us?
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: Obviously not
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: No no
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: See
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - Om Nunase: Anushree said assume avg 40W/m²
8/16/25, 8:05 PM - R.M.: And what about durva?
8/16/25, 8:06 PM - Om Nunase: Once the airframe is build, she'll handle the autopilot part
8/16/25, 8:06 PM - R.M.: Ohh so it's like that... basically our work is now
8/16/25, 8:06 PM - R.M.: After that they r supposed to take over?
8/16/25, 8:07 PM - R.M.: I thought all subdivisions r supposed to work simultaneously
8/16/25, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: Yeah
8/16/25, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: They need airframe naa first to work upon
8/16/25, 8:09 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:11 PM - R.M.: But in rakshak,all subdivisions work independently,and then everything gets merged at the end
8/16/25, 8:11 PM - Om Nunase: Nice
8/16/25, 8:12 PM - R.M.: Like we haven't finalized our structure yet and electrical and software ppl have already done a lot
8/16/25, 8:12 PM - Om Nunase: Ah
8/16/25, 8:12 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:12 PM - Om Nunase: Why cry
8/16/25, 8:14 PM - R.M.: Bcoz in rakshak whatever idea they come up with,i find a fault in everything 🐒
8/16/25, 8:14 PM - R.M.: Even with my propositions 🤣🤣
8/16/25, 8:15 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:15 PM - R.M.: Nd the faults which i indicate r always based on calculations...so no one can even dispute🤣🤣
8/16/25, 8:16 PM - R.M.: Maybe that's why we haven't finalized the structure yet🐒
8/16/25, 8:16 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>

8/16/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:17 PM - R.M.: Ig they r going to kick me out now seriously...bcoz i m the main troublemaker 😭
8/16/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
8/16/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: Nah they won't
8/16/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: Your brain more than compensates
8/16/25, 8:17 PM - R.M.: Everyone tries to explain by cad,I try to find fault by maths🐒 <This message was edited>
8/16/25, 8:17 PM - Om Nunase: Idt youre causing trouble. You're innovating
8/16/25, 8:18 PM - R.M.: But we haven't been able to finalize anything till now 🐒
8/16/25, 8:18 PM - R.M.: But but...
8/16/25, 8:19 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:19 PM - R.M.: See balsa is the best for this
8/16/25, 8:19 PM - R.M.: Usually for these bodies
8/16/25, 8:19 PM - R.M.: We use balsa
8/16/25, 8:19 PM - R.M.: The wing
8/16/25, 8:19 PM - Om Nunase: And how to make the surface of wing
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - R.M.: Surface?
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - Om Nunase: Balsa for ribs or for ribs and surface
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - Om Nunase: Curved surface
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - R.M.: Matlab outer surface?
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - Om Nunase: The outline
8/16/25, 8:20 PM - R.M.: Usually they use balsa only
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: But balsa is expensive 🫰🏻
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: 3d printing seems cheaper to me
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - R.M.: But structural strength
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: 3d printing can give that
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - R.M.: Wait ... I'll ask them if I can get free balsa from rakshak lab
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - Om Nunase: 🥰
8/16/25, 8:21 PM - R.M.: What's the material?
8/16/25, 8:22 PM - R.M.: I don't really trust that
8/16/25, 8:22 PM - Om Nunase: PLA
8/16/25, 8:22 PM - Om Nunase: lightweight PLA also comes
8/16/25, 8:22 PM - R.M.: Hmm
8/16/25, 8:22 PM - R.M.: Is it better than balsa
8/16/25, 8:22 PM - R.M.: Like what r the advantages nd disadvantages
8/16/25, 8:23 PM - Om Nunase: 3d printing you just need to do cad
8/16/25, 8:23 PM - Om Nunase: The rest
8/16/25, 8:23 PM - R.M.: What did u use for rc plane?balsa ?
8/16/25, 8:23 PM - Om Nunase: By printer
8/16/25, 8:23 PM - Om Nunase: Depron
8/16/25, 8:24 PM - R.M.: Ohh lol yeah... forgot that
8/16/25, 8:24 PM - R.M.: Hmm... that's another problem
8/16/25, 8:24 PM - Om Nunase: Why
8/16/25, 8:24 PM - Om Nunase: We'll need the cad anyway
8/16/25, 8:27 PM - R.M.: Nothing...I personally don't prefer cad🐒
8/16/25, 8:28 PM - R.M.: It feels like labourer🐑
8/16/25, 8:44 PM - Om Nunase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FARMsUp6w4w
8/16/25, 8:54 PM - Om Nunase: oii
8/16/25, 8:54 PM - Om Nunase: can you tell/add the Cl and Cd data in the code
8/16/25, 8:57 PM - Om Nunase: also
8/16/25, 8:58 PM - Om Nunase: payload. batao kya carry karna hai :)
8/16/25, 8:58 PM - Om Nunase: koi rough idea
8/16/25, 8:58 PM - Om Nunase: what payloads do rakshak carry?
8/16/25, 8:58 PM - R.M.: Planning to make something like this?
8/16/25, 8:58 PM - R.M.: Cans?balls?
8/16/25, 8:58 PM - R.M.: Code?ya dat sheet?
8/16/25, 8:59 PM - Om Nunase: no no
8/16/25, 9:00 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 9:00 PM - R.M.: This time cans...2024 it was balls
8/16/25, 9:01 PM - Om Nunase: lol
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: i thought its some scientific payload
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - R.M.: Lol this was specified in the competition
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: ikik
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: but still
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: "defense drones"
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: carrying golf balls
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - Om Nunase: just like rocket team carrying dead weight as payload
8/16/25, 9:02 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: Just a name
8/16/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: :)
8/16/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: LOL
8/16/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: but still
8/16/25, 9:03 PM - Om Nunase: konsa payload we should carry
8/16/25, 9:03 PM - R.M.: We shouldn't judge anyone by their name or face...in the same way🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
8/16/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: 1 min
8/16/25, 9:04 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 9:04 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 9:05 PM - R.M.: Purpose?
8/16/25, 9:06 PM - R.M.: R u sure about this?bcoz rakshak mein usually we get 2.5-3 ish
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: for what payload
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: could be any
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - R.M.: Balls(2024)
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - R.M.: 10 balls
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: i meant mass
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - R.M.: Lollllllll
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - R.M.: Wait...lemme check
8/16/25, 9:07 PM - Om Nunase: sounds a bit weird
8/16/25, 9:08 PM - R.M.: 10*350 gm
8/16/25, 9:08 PM - R.M.: Wait wait
8/16/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: one ball 350gm?
8/16/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: what
8/16/25, 9:08 PM - Om Nunase: 3.5 kg payload lol
8/16/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Let me open the file
8/16/25, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: uaqviuwgrwyegbowygtbewoygtvboewt
8/16/25, 9:09 PM - R.M.: Memory loss
8/16/25, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: ucanouhercuahwotnuwhtwoaruvtnhoeiunhvyoeruhneiruynver
8/16/25, 9:09 PM - Om Nunase: i type random sh*t when i crash out
8/16/25, 9:10 PM - R.M.: Accha
8/16/25, 9:10 PM - R.M.: It was
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - R.M.: Around 3 kgs without payload
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - R.M.: Nd u r aiming at 1kg?!?
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: how much payload mass
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: optimistically 1 kg
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: but then
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: it depends what payload do we want to carry
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: maybe a simple camera
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - R.M.: This time it'll b around 350*16 gms
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: or perhaps an array of sensors
8/16/25, 9:11 PM - Om Nunase: total payload mass batado. i dont wanna multiply
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - R.M.: I type meow when I crash out
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - R.M.: 🐒
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - R.M.: 5.6 kgs approx
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - Om Nunase: wait what
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - Om Nunase: 3 kg drone carrying 5.6 kg payload
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - Om Nunase: demn
8/16/25, 9:12 PM - R.M.: Exactly...I m as surprised as u r rn
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - R.M.: Earlier I Calcuted the mass differences
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - Om Nunase: wtf
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - R.M.: That's why structural stability is needed lol
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - Om Nunase: yup
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - Om Nunase: but
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - Om Nunase: i was aiming for like 500-700g payload
8/16/25, 9:13 PM - R.M.: Matlab in team meets... that's why 5.6 didn't strike me
8/16/25, 9:14 PM - R.M.: Wait...let me confirm in the group
8/16/25, 9:14 PM - R.M.: Camera for 1kg?
8/16/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: hmm sure
8/16/25, 9:15 PM - R.M.: But u don't want such a huge payload na <This message was edited>
8/16/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: it maybe like 200g. but lets keep some margin
8/16/25, 9:15 PM - R.M.: Then what's the point 🥲🥲
8/16/25, 9:15 PM - Om Nunase: see we need to demonstrate a reasonable and usable amount of payload naa
8/16/25, 9:16 PM - Om Nunase: 700g fine?
8/16/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: Ig so
8/16/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: Depends on what exactly we want
8/16/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: Like I was seeing the 2024 fuselage
8/16/25, 9:16 PM - R.M.: It had an awesome design
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - R.M.: The way they did it🔥🔥
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - Om Nunase: who did
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - Om Nunase: 2024?
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - R.M.: Nd yeah it was really heavy...
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - R.M.: Rakshak 2024
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - R.M.: We weren't there🥲
8/16/25, 9:17 PM - Om Nunase: hmm
8/16/25, 9:18 PM - R.M.: Still let me ask in the group
8/16/25, 9:18 PM - R.M.: What exactly should I ask? what's the usual weight of fuselage with and without payload?
8/16/25, 9:19 PM - R.M.: If possible u can see it in rakshak lab...it has a mind blowing structural considerations 🔥
8/16/25, 9:20 PM - Om Nunase: i may have seen it
8/16/25, 9:20 PM - Om Nunase: but still
8/16/25, 9:20 PM - R.M.: Still what?
8/16/25, 9:20 PM - R.M.: U want me to bring it to ur lab🐒
8/16/25, 9:21 PM - Om Nunase: nah i want you to fly it in front of my hostel window
8/16/25, 9:22 PM - R.M.: Lol the wings nd fuselage nd electronics r all seperated now🐒
8/16/25, 9:22 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - Om Nunase: so what. attach them and fly. ezz
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: Which one?drag vs velocity graph?
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: Is it of the entire plane?
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - Om Nunase: yeah entire
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - Om Nunase: both graphs
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - R.M.: They r not in usable state anymore
8/16/25, 9:23 PM - Om Nunase: explain the physics :)
8/16/25, 9:24 PM - R.M.: U sent only one graph lol
8/16/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: check code naa
8/16/25, 9:24 PM - Om Nunase: :(
8/16/25, 9:24 PM - R.M.: Waitttt
8/16/25, 9:28 PM - Om Nunase: got it?
8/16/25, 9:32 PM - R.M.: Noooo.... hostel wifi too slow since the morning
8/16/25, 9:32 PM - R.M.: Let it come

8/16/25, 9:39 PM - Om Nunase: no
8/16/25, 9:39 PM - Om Nunase: i meant like you
8/16/25, 9:39 PM - R.M.: U called me fat😭
8/16/25, 9:39 PM - R.M.: Bye
8/16/25, 9:39 PM - Om Nunase: noo. i said ..
8/16/25, 9:39 PM - Om Nunase: little bit fat
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: not too much
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: lol
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - R.M.: U r continuously calling me fat?
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - R.M.: 😭😭
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: noo
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - R.M.: That too means fat
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: nooo
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: everyone has fat
8/16/25, 9:40 PM - Om Nunase: otherwise ppl cant survive
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - R.M.: But u called me fatty
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - R.M.: Little bit fatty
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: 😂😂
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: i meant
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: whatever fat you have
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - Om Nunase: is fine
8/16/25, 9:41 PM - R.M.: Aww thanks ...that means I need to lose 5 kgs
8/16/25, 9:42 PM - R.M.: Btw it came
8/16/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: noo
8/16/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: if you gained more weight you'll look cute
8/16/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: :)
8/16/25, 9:42 PM - Om Nunase: idk why im saying this
8/16/25, 9:42 PM - R.M.: That means I look bad😭
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Just like Mohar?
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - Om Nunase: nooooo
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - Om Nunase: lol
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - Om Nunase: little mohar
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Aww... she's so 🥰🥰
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: I wanna eat her
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - Om Nunase: i meant dont lose more
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - Om Nunase: 😂😂😂😭
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: Ok I won't 🐒🐑
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: But in the drag vs velocity graph
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: I feel
8/16/25, 9:43 PM - R.M.: When velocity is less
8/16/25, 9:44 PM - R.M.: As compared to parasitic drag,induced drag will b more,right
8/16/25, 9:44 PM - R.M.: And it's inversely proportional to V2
8/16/25, 9:45 PM - R.M.: But when velocity increases , parasitic drag will b greater
8/16/25, 9:45 PM - R.M.: Which is proportional to V or V2 (don't remember exactly)
8/16/25, 9:45 PM - R.M.: So it increases
8/16/25, 9:48 PM - R.M.: And the other graph for cl vs cd i feel :cd=cd0+kcl2...at low lift, mainly parasitic drag and high lift induced drag...so steep increase
8/16/25, 9:50 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 10:02 PM - R.M.: Hmm looks fine ig
8/16/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: do you see
8/16/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: min. drag velocity is more than the velocity at which min power is needed
8/16/25, 10:03 PM - Om Nunase: :)
8/16/25, 10:05 PM - R.M.: Lol i thought u wanted me to change the values of mach number corresponding to this for the airfoil
8/16/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: But...?
8/16/25, 10:06 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 10:06 PM - Om Nunase: but nothing. seems weird
8/16/25, 10:06 PM - Om Nunase: but its physics
8/16/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/16/25, 10:06 PM - R.M.: Interesting
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - R.M.: So is it finalized?
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - Om Nunase: no
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - Om Nunase: but seems decent enough
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - Om Nunase: but before finalizing
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - R.M.: Also read these...
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - Om Nunase: we need to check the code
8/16/25, 10:07 PM - R.M.: U used the cl and cd values I gave?
8/16/25, 10:08 PM - R.M.: In case u did... it's going to b a loop

8/16/25, 11:38 PM - R.M.: Uhh fine ...I didn't realise it was too much 🐈
8/16/25, 11:38 PM - Om Nunase: do you think it's easy to make a circuit and charge the cells using solar panels?
8/16/25, 11:38 PM - Om Nunase: it was
8/16/25, 11:39 PM - R.M.: How m I supposed to know that... usually ppl in rakshak support me,so i thought that's actually fine
8/16/25, 11:39 PM - Om Nunase: see. let's first have a proper team meet
8/16/25, 11:39 PM - R.M.: Unless someone has a problem,how m I supposed to get it ..I just generalized things... that's it🐈
8/16/25, 11:39 PM - Om Nunase: we all will get to know each other
8/16/25, 11:39 PM - R.M.: Nvm,now that u told me
8/16/25, 11:40 PM - R.M.: I won't write anything in the group
8/16/25, 11:40 PM - Om Nunase: thats extreme yrr
8/16/25, 11:40 PM - R.M.: Idt that's necessary...bcoz my work has nothing to do with theirs... neither do i understand what they r working on
8/16/25, 11:41 PM - Om Nunase: you can discuss your work obv
8/16/25, 11:41 PM - R.M.: That can b done on dm...why group
8/16/25, 11:42 PM - R.M.: Nvm...I won't text anything on group
8/16/25, 11:42 PM - Om Nunase: why on grp? so that they have an idea of what aerod is like. similarly they'll be discussing what avio and autopilot is like. that's a a team is, right?
8/16/25, 11:42 PM - Om Nunase: pls don't take it otherwise
8/16/25, 11:42 PM - R.M.: Exactly... that's what I m saying...I have no clues about their work
8/16/25, 11:42 PM - Om Nunase: in a negative manner
8/16/25, 11:43 PM - R.M.: Idt that's what a team is supposed to b... atleast that's not what we usually do...🐈
8/16/25, 11:44 PM - Om Nunase: i agree to that. but pls atleast don't dictate what they should be doing. i mean, if you want to do it, just dont be bossy
8/16/25, 11:44 PM - R.M.: Just like I said earlier
8/16/25, 11:44 PM - Om Nunase: as i said, lets have a proper meet, get to know each other.

8/16/25, 11:47 PM - R.M.: Got ur point... that's what I m saying na,since I don't know what exactly is going on, it's better not to type anything
8/16/25, 11:48 PM - R.M.: But what to do if I have no clues about solar and all🐒
8/16/25, 11:48 PM - Om Nunase: you can ask questions
8/16/25, 11:48 PM - R.M.: Not necessary
8/16/25, 11:48 PM - R.M.: I can ask them somewhere else

8/17/25, 4:28 PM - R.M.: No i won't say... u'll b angry
8/17/25, 4:29 PM - R.M.: Bcoz first of all u r super obsessed
8/17/25, 4:29 PM - R.M.: With butane
8/17/25, 4:29 PM - R.M.: Not really
8/17/25, 4:29 PM - Om Nunase: Bcoz that's the only safe thing we can use
8/17/25, 4:29 PM - R.M.: It's a bit complicated...
8/17/25, 4:30 PM - Om Nunase: I can't imagine your angry face 🤣
8/17/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: 😡😡
8/17/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: How dare u reject my geometry 👹
8/17/25, 4:30 PM - R.M.: Now u made me angry like meow🐒
8/17/25, 4:31 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/17/25, 4:31 PM - Om Nunase: Which geometry
8/17/25, 4:31 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
8/17/25, 4:31 PM - Om Nunase: Geometry of your angry face
8/17/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: I was thinking of micromix+bluff(but triangular bluffs)
8/17/25, 4:32 PM - R.M.: Lol what🤣🤣🤣
8/17/25, 4:33 PM - Om Nunase: Again, will it be easy to manufacture?
8/17/25, 4:33 PM - R.M.: Not really...will need precise measurements
8/17/25, 4:33 PM - R.M.: And numerous holes
8/17/25, 4:33 PM - R.M.: For micromix
8/17/25, 4:33 PM - R.M.: 😡😡
8/17/25, 4:34 PM - Om Nunase: 😂
8/17/25, 4:34 PM - R.M.: What made u think so...u only assumed that i wanted to tell this offline...but these r very different things 🐒🐑 <This message was edited>
8/17/25, 4:35 PM - Om Nunase: 🤣
8/17/25, 4:35 PM - R.M.: I mean if we can get majdoors, it's kind of easy
8/17/25, 4:36 PM - R.M.: We just need to give them the dimensions,they can manufacture
8/17/25, 4:36 PM - R.M.: Should I ask ayush whether he's interested?
8/17/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: But wait
....
8/17/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: Butane won't b that convenient
8/17/25, 4:37 PM - R.M.: For this geometry
8/17/25, 4:37 PM - Om Nunase: Nooooo
8/17/25, 4:38 PM - R.M.: Okk fine🤣
8/17/25, 4:39 PM - R.M.: Means obviously it'll b efficient...but for butane the efficiency won't b so much

8/17/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: Also I was just curious to know
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: How do u do all ur projects?
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: Like the cad part
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - Om Nunase: Lol
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: U do on ur own?
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - Om Nunase: By hand?
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - R.M.: Or give it to some majdoor?
8/17/25, 4:45 PM - Om Nunase: See in RT, I'm the lead. So I delegate tasks
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: Bcoz rest everything needs knowledge,not cad part
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: Not RT
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: Some projects reuqire ME to CAD
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: Except tech team
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: So I CAD
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: Myslef
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: Other projects
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: By hand and brain
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: Ohh but isn't that boring
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - R.M.: I mean no real knowledge is applied
8/17/25, 4:46 PM - Om Nunase: Excuse me?
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - Om Nunase: cad is brain intensive
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - Om Nunase: It's not a joke
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - R.M.: U can have the idea in ur mind and tell all the measurements to a majdoor,(s)he can do it
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - R.M.: Is it?damn!!
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - Om Nunase: You need to know a lot in order to do a perfect cad
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - Om Nunase: Haa measurement and all that is fine
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - R.M.: Ohh shit!!I didn't know this
8/17/25, 4:47 PM - Om Nunase: But the "design" part is brain intensive
8/17/25, 4:48 PM - Om Nunase: 😡
8/17/25, 4:48 PM - R.M.: I meant u can have the design on ur mind
8/17/25, 4:48 PM - R.M.: And tell ppl to do it on software
8/17/25, 4:48 PM - Om Nunase: That "design" part is a tricky thing
8/17/25, 4:48 PM - Om Nunase: Cading happens In brain
8/17/25, 4:49 PM - R.M.: Lol idk...I always find the simulation and constraint parts more interesting 🐒

8/17/25, 7:58 PM - R.M.: This aids is so frustrating 😭
8/17/25, 7:58 PM - Om Nunase: 200% means you should also do what isn't told but will improve things
8/17/25, 7:59 PM - Om Nunase: yeah. theres no vaccine for that right?
8/17/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: Ik... that's why I said na I'll check the geometry after dinner...u didn't expect us to do that🐑🐒
8/17/25, 7:59 PM - R.M.: .
8/17/25, 8:00 PM - R.M.: After that I said to check it, only when I pointed it out🐥🐥

8/19/25, 10:26 AM - Om Nunase: Instead of staying in wet clothes
8/19/25, 10:27 AM - R.M.: But the thing is if I change and come back, it's again gonna b qet
8/19/25, 10:27 AM - Om Nunase: 🙂
8/19/25, 10:27 AM - Om Nunase: Vicious cycle

8/19/25, 1:22 PM - Om Nunase: Nvm
8/19/25, 1:22 PM - Om Nunase: Tell
8/19/25, 1:22 PM - Om Nunase: Min power or min drag
8/19/25, 1:22 PM - R.M.: To bhi i won't answer
8/19/25, 1:22 PM - R.M.: Depends on the mission
8/19/25, 1:22 PM - R.M.: Like what exactly we want
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - Om Nunase: We can decide the cruise velocity
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - Om Nunase: One gives min drag
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - Om Nunase: Another requires min power
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - R.M.: Trade off
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - R.M.: Usually in this situation
8/19/25, 1:23 PM - Om Nunase: The mission is yk
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - Om Nunase: We have limited solar capacity
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - R.M.: Our aero seniors said make a intelligent trade off
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - Om Nunase: Like we need to squeeze it every mW from the solar panels
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - Om Nunase: I was confused
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - R.M.: But I feel,we should optimize for drag
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - Om Nunase: Min drag requires min thrust. So motors will consume less
8/19/25, 1:24 PM - Om Nunase: But then
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - Om Nunase: Min power, what else would it mean then
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - Om Nunase: Same thing na
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - Om Nunase: See
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - R.M.: But see we need it to b on flight for 48 hrs
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - R.M.: So induced drag contribution should b less
8/19/25, 1:25 PM - Om Nunase: So we don't need high speed necessarily
8/19/25, 1:26 PM - R.M.: So what... parasitic drag will b tehre
8/19/25, 1:26 PM - Om Nunase: Haa
8/19/25, 1:26 PM - Om Nunase: So which cruise velocity will consume less power from the solar panel
8/19/25, 1:26 PM - Om Nunase: That's all I'm asking
8/19/25, 1:26 PM - R.M.: Wait
8/19/25, 1:26 PM - Om Nunase: Got confused?
8/19/25, 1:27 PM - R.M.: Nhi nhi
8/19/25, 1:27 PM - R.M.: Actually I came to buy shampoo,but wasn't getting one
8/19/25, 1:27 PM - R.M.: So...
8/19/25, 1:27 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/19/25, 1:27 PM - R.M.: Now wait...lemme think properly...I was just telling the usual case
8/19/25, 1:27 PM - R.M.: In such a dillema we usually optimize
8/19/25, 1:28 PM - R.M.: So basically u r saying
8/19/25, 1:28 PM - R.M.: In a particular cruise velocity,we r getting min drag
8/19/25, 1:28 PM - R.M.: And in other one we r getting min power consumption
8/19/25, 1:28 PM - R.M.: Right?
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - Om Nunase: Oh wait
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - Om Nunase: I think we should choose this
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - R.M.: Nd r those velocities very different
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - R.M.: Like?can u send me the graph
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/19/25, 1:29 PM - R.M.: Might b risky
8/19/25, 1:30 PM - Om Nunase: See the first 2 graphs
8/19/25, 1:30 PM - R.M.: Lollll
8/19/25, 1:30 PM - R.M.: Velocities r almost the same
8/19/25, 1:30 PM - Om Nunase: No
8/19/25, 1:30 PM - Om Nunase: Can't you see
8/19/25, 1:30 PM - R.M.: Matlab thoda sa difference
8/19/25, 1:31 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/19/25, 1:31 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
8/19/25, 1:31 PM - R.M.: Take around 8
8/19/25, 1:31 PM - R.M.: Will b optimal ig
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: Bruh
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: Why
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: Min power
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: We want min power naa
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - R.M.: This is fine...but if velocity is 8, doesn't make difference... basically the slope is very less
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: Ehh
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: It will
8/19/25, 1:32 PM - Om Nunase: Considering the flight time isn't in seconds, it's in hours
8/19/25, 1:33 PM - R.M.: Yeah but what about drag
8/19/25, 1:34 PM - R.M.: I m just scared about parasitic drag
8/19/25, 1:34 PM - R.M.: Induced drag can b taken care of🐒
8/19/25, 1:34 PM - Om Nunase: Wait
8/19/25, 1:34 PM - Om Nunase: Check the code. It includes all kinds of drag
8/19/25, 1:34 PM - R.M.: Ik
8/19/25, 1:35 PM - R.M.: I m saying about real life
8/19/25, 1:35 PM - Om Nunase: Tabhi toh there's a minimum not at zero
8/19/25, 1:35 PM - R.M.: Bcoz code mei there is thoda sa approximation
8/19/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: I remember that🐱🐱...I m saying suppose if u r focusing on minimum power,and drag increases a lot
8/19/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: .
8/19/25, 1:36 PM - Om Nunase: Acha
8/19/25, 1:36 PM - R.M.: Can't we use more solar panels 🐒
8/19/25, 1:36 PM - Om Nunase: But min power is drag*velocity
8/19/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: Hmm
8/19/25, 1:37 PM - R.M.: 🐒🐒🐱
8/19/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: Best is plot the graphs for both cases in the velocity domain of 6 to 10...then optimize
8/19/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: By using best fit method
8/19/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: 🐒🐥🐥
8/19/25, 1:38 PM - Om Nunase: That's what I've done here na
8/19/25, 1:38 PM - Om Nunase: See x axis
8/19/25, 1:38 PM - R.M.: I was saying both plots in the same graph
8/19/25, 1:39 PM - R.M.: And one best fit line for both the plots
8/19/25, 1:39 PM - Om Nunase: Average of the two?
8/19/25, 1:39 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/19/25, 1:39 PM - R.M.: Nah nah...use weightage
8/19/25, 1:39 PM - R.M.: Suppose give solar power 70% and drag 30%
8/19/25, 1:40 PM - R.M.: Why r u beating me😭😭
8/19/25, 8:02 PM - R.M.: Have u started with the V0?
8/19/25, 8:03 PM - R.M.: *taking bombay flood into consideration 🐒🐒
8/19/25, 8:06 PM - Om Nunase: 😂😭

8/22/25, 12:55 AM - Om Nunase: How big lol
8/22/25, 12:56 AM - R.M.: Or somewhere... don't remember exactly...that day they were saying, I don't remember the location exactly...most probably mechanical
8/22/25, 12:56 AM - R.M.: Atleast we can do it for v1
8/22/25, 12:56 AM - R.M.: Bcoz sir also said in class
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Let's discuss this afterwards
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: First make the glider
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - R.M.: That most aeromodelling ppl get less values as compared to theoretical values
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: 🫠
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - R.M.: That's bcoz of this renold and mach scaling issues
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Hmm hmm
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: See
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - R.M.: So it's better to test
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Please
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Don't overthink now
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - R.M.: 😡😡
8/22/25, 12:57 AM - Om Nunase: Just make the glider
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - Om Nunase: Glider is so that we can get started
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - Om Nunase: Later we can do wind tunnel thing
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - Om Nunase: But later
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - Om Nunase: Not now
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - Om Nunase: First give me glider configuration
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - Om Nunase: We'll discuss other things later
8/22/25, 12:58 AM - R.M.: What's the usual wing span ?
8/22/25, 1:00 AM - R.M.: Do i have any constraints,or should I play around randomly?
8/22/25, 1:08 AM - Om Nunase: The only constrain is that the carbon rod is 1m long and you have two such rods
8/22/25, 1:08 AM - Om Nunase: Use one for wing
8/22/25, 1:08 AM - Om Nunase: Other for fuselage
8/22/25, 1:14 AM - R.M.: Did u edit the code?
8/22/25, 2:02 AM - R.M.: With a wingspan of 1 m ,how to increase l/d ratio
8/22/25, 2:03 AM - R.M.: Whatever I m doing, it's just getting concentrated near 4😭😭 <This message was edited>
8/22/25, 2:43 AM - R.M.: The values I m getting rnt that effective ig... actually 1 m for wingspan is quite less
8/22/25, 2:43 AM - R.M.: What do u think?
8/22/25, 2:45 AM - R.M.: I mean see if wingspan is 1m, then stabilizers will b very very small, around 15 cm...so will b fuselage and everything else🐒
8/22/25, 11:35 AM - Om Nunase: Reduce the mass 🫠
8/22/25, 11:37 AM - R.M.: Lol how...see I m reducing the length and diameter of everything
8/22/25, 11:37 AM - R.M.: But density will b the same na
8/22/25, 11:38 AM - Om Nunase: There's a slider
8/22/25, 11:38 AM - R.M.: So accordingly mass is already reduced
8/22/25, 11:38 AM - R.M.: Ik
8/22/25, 11:38 AM - R.M.: In fact mass is reduced too much
8/22/25, 11:38 AM - Om Nunase: Density of what
8/22/25, 11:39 AM - R.M.: But lift/ drag ratio won't vary on that
8/22/25, 11:39 AM - Om Nunase: Wait which code are you using
8/22/25, 11:39 AM - Om Nunase: Send ss
8/22/25, 11:39 AM - R.M.: Material we r using...3d print
8/22/25, 11:39 AM - R.M.: 3.0 interactive design code
8/22/25, 11:39 AM - Om Nunase: There is a slider for the total mass of the plane I believe. Send ss of the sliders
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - R.M.: Lol i don't have my laptop open now
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - Om Nunase: Huh
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - R.M.: +a cat is sitting on my lap,so I can't move <This message was edited>
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - Om Nunase: 🤡
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - Om Nunase: Bruh
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - R.M.: I m not in lhc or room
8/22/25, 11:40 AM - Om Nunase: 🦧
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - Om Nunase: Then, kolkata?
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - R.M.: I was coming back to room,but baby sat
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - R.M.: On my lap
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - R.M.: Mess...not for eating,just baby sat,so I can't move
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - R.M.: She's resting
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - R.M.: I won't wake her up
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - Om Nunase: 🤧🫠
8/22/25, 11:41 AM - R.M.: Lol we had a quiz today🐒🐒
8/22/25, 11:42 AM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 11:42 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 11:42 AM - R.M.: See baby
8/22/25, 11:42 AM - Om Nunase: 😭
8/22/25, 11:43 AM - R.M.: Doesn't look like she'll move in sometime
8/22/25, 11:43 AM - R.M.: So i m stuck here🐒
8/22/25, 11:43 AM - Om Nunase: Keep the laptop over this pillow. Baby will feel warm in this cold weather
8/22/25, 11:43 AM - R.M.: I didn't carry my laptop to lhc... considering whatever happened that day
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - R.M.: 🐒🐒
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - R.M.: So laptop is not with me rn
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - Om Nunase: Fine
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - R.M.: It's in my room
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - R.M.: Pillow🥰🥰
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 11:44 AM - R.M.: See this was the 3.0 one na
8/22/25, 11:45 AM - R.M.: Nooooo😭😭
8/22/25, 11:45 AM - Om Nunase: Yes. There's a slider for mass
8/22/25, 11:45 AM - R.M.: But it doesn't make sense at all
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - R.M.: See when we have the configuration fixed
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - R.M.: And density constant
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - R.M.: Mass is supposed to b directly calculated,right?
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - Om Nunase: But changing the wingspan changes the mass of the plane
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - R.M.: Yeah i meant
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - Om Nunase: It's an input
8/22/25, 11:46 AM - R.M.: I have a design in mind,right?
8/22/25, 11:47 AM - R.M.: Like u said carbon rod is 1m...so wingspan is 1 m
8/22/25, 11:47 AM - Om Nunase: See whatever aerodynamic design you have. Just assign a rough mass estimate
8/22/25, 11:47 AM - R.M.: U r not getting my point 😭😭
8/22/25, 11:47 AM - R.M.: See...
8/22/25, 11:47 AM - Om Nunase: Mass affects the amount of lift needed to generate
8/22/25, 11:48 AM - R.M.: We have wingspan, fuselage length as 1m, fuselage diameter as 0.1 or something,so do we have horizontal and vertical stabilizer area and length...bcoz since we have wingspan and fuselage and 1 m,for max efficiency we can calculate the rest
8/22/25, 11:48 AM - Om Nunase: You mean L/D ratio should be same for any mass
8/22/25, 11:49 AM - R.M.: And accordingly mass will change
8/22/25, 11:49 AM - Om Nunase: You can derive the tail areas from this code itself. There's something called tail coefficient
8/22/25, 11:49 AM - R.M.: Yeah yeah
8/22/25, 11:49 AM - Om Nunase: Right, and then you input that mass in this code
8/22/25, 11:50 AM - R.M.: Wait...just a minute
8/22/25, 11:50 AM - R.M.: Tell me one thing
8/22/25, 11:50 AM - R.M.: When we have the exact configuration in the code
8/22/25, 11:50 AM - R.M.: And the density also inputed
8/22/25, 11:50 AM - R.M.: So won't mass b a dependent variable
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - R.M.: Why is it still becoming independent?
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - Om Nunase: Where
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - R.M.: See na u already did in the code
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - Om Nunase: Are you sure
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - Om Nunase: Check one more time
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - R.M.: Density of 1250 kg/m3 or something
8/22/25, 11:51 AM - R.M.: For pla
8/22/25, 11:52 AM - R.M.: Accha wait...
8/22/25, 11:52 AM - R.M.: I mean yesterday I m sure i saw it🐒🐒
8/22/25, 11:52 AM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 11:52 AM - R.M.: But but...😭
8/22/25, 11:54 AM - Om Nunase: Just come up with a configuration. I chose you so that I can focus on handling the overall team <This message was edited>
8/22/25, 11:55 AM - R.M.: Wait...
8/22/25, 11:55 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 11:55 AM - R.M.: No slider for mass
8/22/25, 11:55 AM - Om Nunase: Hmm hmm
8/22/25, 11:55 AM - Om Nunase: I edited the code
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: Is it a different code then?
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: Ohh
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - Om Nunase: Use this one please
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: But isn't density constant
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: Like when using pla
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - Om Nunase: Name of the code
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: Value should always b the same
8/22/25, 11:56 AM - R.M.: SAP interactive design code 3.0
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - Om Nunase: Spa
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - Om Nunase: But ok
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - R.M.: Same thing 🐒🐒
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - Om Nunase: CAT and ACT are same?
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - R.M.: But but...😭😭
8/22/25, 11:57 AM - Om Nunase: Nvm
8/22/25, 11:58 AM - R.M.: See i can't come up with any random config...like l/d is very less
8/22/25, 11:58 AM - R.M.: Whatever I m doing 😭😭
8/22/25, 11:58 AM - Om Nunase: Look
8/22/25, 11:58 AM - R.M.: Accha wait...nvm,I have a better idea
8/22/25, 11:59 AM - Om Nunase: This isn't an exact model of the aircraft. The wings are assumed flat. So decide the thickness accordingly.

If for example the thickness of the airfoil material is 2mm and you squash the airfoil, is thickness will be doubled to 4mm. Assign this 4mm in wing thickness
8/22/25, 12:00 PM - Om Nunase: Why are you taking so much time to come to with glider configuration
8/22/25, 12:00 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:00 PM - R.M.: Bcoz i m not able to get a good aerodynamic design 🐒
8/22/25, 12:00 PM - Om Nunase: Just get it
8/22/25, 12:01 PM - Om Nunase: Send me this glider ka ss
8/22/25, 12:01 PM - R.M.: Something or the other is coming up to b an issue...now it's lift
8/22/25, 12:01 PM - Om Nunase: .
8/22/25, 12:01 PM - Om Nunase: I'll check the design
8/22/25, 12:01 PM - Om Nunase: You need to send it before talking more
8/22/25, 12:01 PM - R.M.: Wait
8/22/25, 12:02 PM - R.M.: Let me make a few changes
8/22/25, 12:02 PM - Om Nunase: I don't have the energy to talk much. I'm still recovering
8/22/25, 12:02 PM - Om Nunase: Please do it and then just send me the ss before discussing anything more
8/22/25, 12:02 PM - Om Nunase: Don't talk then
8/22/25, 12:02 PM - R.M.: Ok fine
8/22/25, 12:02 PM - R.M.: Sorry 😭
8/22/25, 12:17 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:17 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:18 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:18 PM - Om Nunase: There's some bug then
8/22/25, 12:18 PM - Om Nunase: Aisi
8/22/25, 12:18 PM - Om Nunase: Also
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - Om Nunase: Wing cant be 5 kg
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - R.M.: Exactly... that's what I was thinking
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - Om Nunase: Something's definitely wrong
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - Om Nunase: Check
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - R.M.: See they set aspect ratio to 0.1
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - R.M.: Maybe that's the main problem
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - Om Nunase: .
8/22/25, 12:19 PM - R.M.: U think I didn't
8/22/25, 12:20 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:20 PM - R.M.: The minimum is starting from 5
8/22/25, 12:20 PM - R.M.: 0.1 is not even in the range
8/22/25, 12:23 PM - R.M.: I m just using ur code... didn't make any changes
8/22/25, 12:23 PM - R.M.: Were u getting the right values?
8/22/25, 12:27 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:27 PM - R.M.: Problem is with the table
8/22/25, 12:42 PM - R.M.: Nvm...they used AR as 0.1 only bcoz of the trapezoid formula u used
8/22/25, 12:45 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 12:59 PM - R.M.: What's a realistic mass for this plane?
8/22/25, 12:59 PM - R.M.: Below 1 kg,right?
8/22/25, 1:05 PM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/22/25, 1:09 PM - R.M.: Then actually u can do one thing... decrease the diameter of fuselage 0.05 seems feasible,right?
8/22/25, 2:21 PM - R.M.: EUREKA!!
8/22/25, 2:21 PM - R.M.: L/D value is coming in an acceptable range now🥳🥳🥳
8/22/25, 2:30 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 2:30 PM - R.M.: Bcoz of the bug that existed in ur code😭😭
8/22/25, 2:31 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 2:32 PM - Om Nunase: Nice
8/22/25, 2:33 PM - R.M.: U know what was the bug
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - Om Nunase: No
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - R.M.: When wing span is too less
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - R.M.: During calculation, python is ignoring the less significant terns
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - R.M.: So it's looping
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - Om Nunase: 💀
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - R.M.: And giving nonsense results
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 2:34 PM - Om Nunase: Again 😭😭😭
8/22/25, 2:35 PM - R.M.: I mean the code isn't wrong...but u had to include more restrictions for small values
8/22/25, 2:35 PM - R.M.: I took so long to identify the bug🐒🐒
8/22/25, 2:35 PM - R.M.: Yeah...why did u send it again 😭
8/22/25, 2:39 PM - Om Nunase: That's why I told. Verify the code
8/22/25, 2:39 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 2:55 PM - R.M.: I did
8/22/25, 2:55 PM - R.M.: There was no mistake
8/22/25, 2:56 PM - R.M.: But I m not a programmer that I m supposed to know python won't take insignificant digits 🐒🐒
8/22/25, 2:57 PM - Om Nunase: Become one
8/22/25, 2:57 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 2:58 PM - R.M.: Nah... it's better to not know it
8/22/25, 2:58 PM - R.M.: Coding is so boring 😭
8/22/25, 2:58 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 2:58 PM - R.M.: Why r u beating me 😭
8/22/25, 2:58 PM - R.M.: Again 😭
8/22/25, 2:59 PM - R.M.: So when r u planning to make it?
8/22/25, 3:00 PM - Om Nunase: So this is final? Or any refinements
8/22/25, 3:01 PM - R.M.: See first of all
8/22/25, 3:01 PM - R.M.: Will u use polypropylene?
8/22/25, 3:01 PM - R.M.: For 3d print
8/22/25, 6:21 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 6:21 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 6:22 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 6:46 PM - Om Nunase: PLA is available easily and I've worked with it too
8/22/25, 6:46 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 6:46 PM - R.M.: But mass is getting high
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - R.M.: 3.12 or something like that
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - Om Nunase: 3.12 kg for the glider? How
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - Om Nunase: Wait wait
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - Om Nunase: 4 mm thick is too thick
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - Om Nunase: See
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - R.M.: Yup...calculate it
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - Om Nunase: 1 mm thick the airfoil can be.

So set the thickness to 2mm
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - Om Nunase: You understand right why are we setting 2mm
8/22/25, 6:47 PM - R.M.: And what about the stabilizers then?
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - Om Nunase: Same thickness
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - R.M.: Accha so all is 2 mm
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - Om Nunase: I'm at TL btw
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - R.M.: Fine... won't change lift and drag too much
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - R.M.: Only mass will b less
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - R.M.: Nice...
8/22/25, 6:48 PM - R.M.: I m in room🐒🐒
8/22/25, 6:49 PM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/22/25, 6:49 PM - R.M.: See what u did,after saying u r in tl,u started beating me😭😭
8/22/25, 6:49 PM - R.M.: Don't u have rt today?
8/22/25, 6:49 PM - Om Nunase: I do
8/22/25, 6:49 PM - R.M.: Then?
8/22/25, 6:49 PM - Om Nunase: At 9: 30
8/22/25, 6:50 PM - R.M.: I too have rakshak at 9:30...so I m at room now
8/22/25, 6:50 PM - R.M.: <Media omitted>

8/22/25, 6:51 PM - Om Nunase: What, cat?
8/22/25, 6:51 PM - R.M.: Whether they have polypropylene
8/22/25, 6:51 PM - R.M.: Lol what🤣🤣
8/22/25, 6:51 PM - Om Nunase: We need to buy if we're going to use

8/24/25, 1:48 AM - R.M.: Don't focus on a particular machine
8/24/25, 1:48 AM - R.M.: For example
8/24/25, 1:48 AM - Om Nunase: Machine?
8/24/25, 1:48 AM - R.M.: Don't focus on say
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - R.M.: Turbofan as a whole
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - R.M.: Do it,learn it
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - Om Nunase: Hmm
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - R.M.: But focus on the fluids properties
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - R.M.: Or the combustion properties
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - R.M.: I mean for projects
8/24/25, 1:49 AM - R.M.: Something i should have done earlier 😭😭

8/24/25, 2:15 AM - Om Nunase: 😎
8/24/25, 2:16 AM - R.M.: In aerodynamics, 
You can go for
Turbulence 
Hypersonic 
Supersonic 
Low speed aerodynamics 
Shock wave boundary layer interactions 

In propulsion,
Turbulent combustion 
Multiphase flows (safe for interview 😂😂)
Heat transfer (safe)
Combustion instability 
Rocket fuels
8/24/25, 2:16 AM - R.M.: He sent this

8/24/25, 2:42 AM - Om Nunase: Make a cat space program
8/24/25, 2:42 AM - Om Nunase: Ok let's get back to topic
8/24/25, 2:42 AM - R.M.: And u r given 4 years,right?
8/24/25, 2:42 AM - R.M.: So in 4 years u need to b better than others
8/24/25, 2:42 AM - R.M.: So how is it possible?
8/24/25, 2:42 AM - R.M.: What do they want?
8/24/25, 2:43 AM - R.M.: They want research experience...like it'll show how dedicated u r and how talented u r
8/24/25, 2:43 AM - R.M.: And most importantly commitment
8/24/25, 2:44 AM - Om Nunase: Yes
8/24/25, 2:44 AM - R.M.: So say in lieu of company u take university or any research lab,so in 2 months u can b slightly better... it'll slightly increase the edge of u getting selected
8/24/25, 2:44 AM - R.M.: Vraj had 4 research experiences
8/24/25, 2:44 AM - R.M.: Still he got rejected from caltech
8/24/25, 2:45 AM - R.M.: Can u imagine the situation 😭
8/24/25, 2:45 AM - Om Nunase: 🤧
8/24/25, 2:45 AM - Om Nunase: 4 is not a joke
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - R.M.: Ikr
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - R.M.: So how r we going to do that?
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - R.M.: I mean these r proper research
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - R.M.: Not tech team
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - Om Nunase: 🥲
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - Om Nunase: I'm so behind then
8/24/25, 2:46 AM - R.M.: Exactly... that's what I have been trying to tell u🐒
8/24/25, 2:47 AM - R.M.: Nd u know na
8/24/25, 2:47 AM - R.M.: The criteria is 2 lor s
8/24/25, 2:47 AM - Om Nunase: 😭😭😭
8/24/25, 2:47 AM - R.M.: Nd usually in top universities,ppl with 3-4 get selected
8/24/25, 2:48 AM - Om Nunase: <Media omitted>
8/24/25, 2:48 AM - R.M.: To b on the safe side...but with this say u can get selected in the 15th university if ur cpi is 8.7+
8/24/25, 2:49 AM - Om Nunase: 🥲🥲🥲
8/24/25, 2:49 AM - Om Nunase: Need more cpi
8/24/25, 2:49 AM - R.M.: The one I said
8/24/25, 2:49 AM - R.M.: Is if u have a bachelors in aero
8/24/25, 2:50 AM - R.M.: For chemical, it's slightly less... matlab a bit less cpi is acceptable
8/24/25, 2:50 AM - Om Nunase: 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🦧🤧🤧
8/24/25, 2:50 AM - R.M.: Like for aero if it's 15 th,for chem it'll b say 10th
8/24/25, 2:50 AM - Om Nunase: Univ ranking?
8/24/25, 2:50 AM - R.M.: Yup
8/24/25, 2:50 AM - Om Nunase: Then why are you so sad with chem
8/24/25, 2:51 AM - R.M.: Bcoz i don't want a bachelors in chemical
8/24/25, 2:51 AM - R.M.: I mean with aero bachelors too
8/24/25, 2:52 AM - Om Nunase: 🥲
8/24/25, 2:52 AM - R.M.: If I put the same effort,my cpi uld b almost same
8/24/25, 2:52 AM - R.M.: +I'll b having atleast 4 lors already
8/24/25, 2:52 AM - R.M.: So it uldnt have affected much
8/24/25, 2:53 AM - R.M.: Except university...but in PhD i could have gotten a better option
8/24/25, 2:53 AM - R.M.: U got this calculation?
8/24/25, 2:54 AM - Om Nunase: No
8/24/25, 2:54 AM - R.M.: 1st year intern+2nd year intern+3rd year intern+slp
8/24/25, 2:54 AM - R.M.: So minimum 4
8/24/25, 2:54 AM - Om Nunase: Ah
8/24/25, 2:54 AM - Om Nunase: 🦧
8/24/25, 2:54 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>

8/24/25, 4:02 AM - R.M.: Dear Professor Adrián Lozano-Durán,

I am Vraj Kanubhai Patel, a final-year undergraduate in Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), India, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I hold a CGPA of 9.12 with a department rank of 5. I am reaching out to explore potential research opportunities under your guidance at Computational Turbulence Group.

My interests lie in the interaction of aerodynamics, turbulent flows, combustion, and hypersonics. While exploring current research that interests me, I found your work in a similar field on the dynamics of turbulent flows. I was intrigued by your work on high-fidelity simulations using AI and ML. Given my minor in AI, I am excited by the prospect of combining turbulence modeling with AI techniques and would be eager to contribute to this state-of-the-art research. 

Currently, I am working on a bachelor’s thesis titled “CFD and CMC model for turbulent combustion” under the guidance of Professor Sreedhara Sheshadri. I studied the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) model, investigating first--, second-, and third-order closures to evaluate their role in modeling reaction rate terms for turbulent combustion. I plan to extend this work by applying the Professor’s CFD-CMC coupled model to Sandia flames and validating the results with experimental data.

Additionally, I have contributed to two research projects, “Ceiling fan blade optimization for noise reduction” and “Drone arm optimization for drag reduction,” under the guidance of Professor Dhwanil Shukla. Inspired by the silent flight of white owls, I  implemented trailing edge serration to reduce fan noise. I am also a part of the technical team Rakshak, working on designing and manufacturing fixed-wing UAVs and drones under the supervision of Professor Krishnendu Haldar. I also participated in a research competition organized by Lufthansa, where I extensively studied contrail formation and its environmental effects. My team and I proposed an algorithm to optimize flight paths to mitigate contrail occurrence. 

These experiences have fueled my passion for turbulence and aerodynamics research and motivated me to seek advanced research opportunities. I would appreciate the opportunity to work under your guidance. I would be happy to meet with you for a discussion at your preferred time.

I have attached my CV and transcript for your perusal. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss potential research opportunities at your convenience. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Regards,
Vraj Kanubhai Patel

8/28/25, 3:33 AM - R.M.: And to get a real life experience
8/28/25, 3:33 AM - R.M.: Then it slowly started spanning other aeronautics and astronautics aspects as well
8/28/25, 3:34 AM - R.M.: <Media omitted>
8/28/25, 3:34 AM - Om Nunase: acha

8/28/25, 3:37 AM - R.M.: True
8/28/25, 3:37 AM - Om Nunase: and through my nani home there was only a small viewi g area. so planes use to just come and go i  a second. that perhaps created mystery
