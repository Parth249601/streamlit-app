15/04/2025, 22:01 - Om Paglu: I also cribbed for that 10 marks,no response till now
15/04/2025, 22:02 - Om Paglu: Kinda getting stressed now😭
15/04/2025, 22:03 - Parth Bansal: same but not stressed
15/04/2025, 22:03 - Om Paglu: Arey yaar mine was calculation error
15/04/2025, 22:03 - Om Paglu: And 10 marks can affect grade as a whole
15/04/2025, 22:04 - Om Paglu: U cribbed for 5 marks na?
15/04/2025, 22:04 - Parth Bansal: yea thats like 10->9 or 9->8 or 8->7

15/04/2025, 22:05 - Parth Bansal: bro getting aero minor is not that hard u only need to pass 5 courses(jokes) <This message was edited>
15/04/2025, 22:06 - Parth Bansal: chill it will be updated
15/04/2025, 22:11 - Om Paglu: Bro aero is ok,but for a good university,a very high cpi is needed
15/04/2025, 22:11 - Om Paglu: Vaise to 9 is also kinda less
15/04/2025, 22:12 - Om Paglu: Can u imagine those PhD ppl made error in marks calculation,they just want us to get stuck in India just like them😡😡
16/04/2025, 10:08 - Parth Bansal: ya they were prolly busy doing their stuff i don't think they are interested in correcting our papers that's why he made such error
16/04/2025, 11:55 - Om Paglu: nhi,actually it's their conspiracy.They don't want tech ppl to go for masters or phd in USA or Europe,and be stuck in India just like them
16/04/2025, 23:48 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
16/04/2025, 23:48 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
16/04/2025, 23:49 - Om Paglu: So how to solve?does it follow linear relation or something else?
17/04/2025, 00:09 - Parth Bansal: yea maybe they did extrapolation
17/04/2025, 00:17 - Om Paglu: Extrapolation in the sense they assumed linear relation kya?
17/04/2025, 00:17 - Om Paglu: Or what what kind of function?
17/04/2025, 09:17 - Parth Bansal: Linear
17/04/2025, 10:19 - Om Paglu: Accha
17/04/2025, 10:19 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
17/04/2025, 10:20 - Om Paglu: Usually in heaviside functions,the upper bound in  the previous interval=lower bound of next interval
17/04/2025, 10:20 - Om Paglu: Here,in part 2, it's t<2 and in the next part it's t>=3
17/04/2025, 10:25 - Parth Bansal: There will be different answers for 0<t<2 and t>= 3pi
17/04/2025, 10:26 - Om Paglu: R u sure?bcoz usually in heaviside functions,I have never seen questions like this
17/04/2025, 10:26 - Om Paglu: Logically it should b
17/04/2025, 10:28 - Parth Bansal: I m telling what I beleive is true so yeah acc to me there will be different answers in diff ranges
17/04/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
18/04/2025, 10:50 - Parth Bansal: convolution
18/04/2025, 10:50 - Parth Bansal: but where did you get this question from?
18/04/2025, 12:17 - Om Paglu: That's understandable,but like how exactly do u break it in intervals
18/04/2025, 12:17 - Om Paglu: Can u plz send the solution of this
18/04/2025, 12:17 - Om Paglu: Tuts only
18/04/2025, 12:19 - Om Paglu: Though it's a common question in trench too
18/04/2025, 14:20 - Om Paglu: Dear All,

(0) All re-evaluation requests for the quiz will get full consideration. So kindly do not get stressed out thinking that your request has been missed. The updated marks will be shared with you after the end semester exam. 

(1) The format of the end semester exam will be the same as that of the quiz. You will have to write your final answers in the question paper cum answer sheet and we will collect only this sheet back from you. You will receive exactly one booklet of 12 pages for rough work, and no extra material for rough work. We will not be collecting this rough work.

(2) The duration of the exam will be 2 hours, from 13.30 to 15.30. You will not be allowed to leave the exam hall during this period. Bathroom breaks are not allowed. 

(3) The seating arrangement file can be found here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/132X_kNzEumW-iuzuQkjKhdU2Jbx-BTmp/view?usp=sharing

Kindly note and write down your tutorial batch carefully. This is also mentioned in your seating arrangement file.

(4) Please make sure that you are in your seat by 13.20. Please make sure that you are carrying your IIT-B identity card with you. 

(5) Please make sure that your mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. If your mobile phone causes any disturbance during the exam, 5 marks will be deducted from your end sem score. In fact, I would suggest leaving them in your hostel room, if possible.

(6) There are 11 questions in total. These questions are based on the material in tutorial sheets 4,5,6. If you are thorough with the solutions of the problems solved in the tutorials (the solutions to these have been shared with you), then you should be able to do well in the end sem.

(7) In my opinion the questions in the quiz are fairly easy for someone who has practiced several questions from the tutorial sheets. However, as we will be checking only the final answer, it is important that you should be able to do things quickly and accurately, something which you will be able to do if you have enough practice.

21/04/2025, 01:12 - Parth Bansal: Yes
21/04/2025, 01:12 - Parth Bansal: You have calculate for what values are they 2
21/04/2025, 01:12 - Om Paglu: Okk,thanks
21/04/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: Btw,for different combinations energy will be different
21/04/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: So which one r u supposed to consider?
21/04/2025, 01:29 - Parth Bansal: There are different combinations which result in a certain energy
21/04/2025, 01:30 - Parth Bansal: And all these are valid combinations tions
21/04/2025, 01:30 - Parth Bansal: We need to report total number of combinations
21/04/2025, 07:30 - Om Paglu: Accha got it, thanks
21/04/2025, 12:18 - Om Paglu: U solved that 4 vector?
21/04/2025, 12:40 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
21/04/2025, 12:41 - Parth Bansal: E = 7mc^2 in the lab frame 
And 2mc^2 in the COM frame
21/04/2025, 12:47 - Om Paglu: Lol,u remembered 4 vectors??
21/04/2025, 12:47 - Parth Bansal: Yes
21/04/2025, 12:47 - Om Paglu: I just wrote trash
21/04/2025, 12:47 - Om Paglu: Matlab u revised it few days ago?

21/04/2025, 12:48 - Om Paglu: Bcoz prof mentioned in mail
21/04/2025, 12:48 - Om Paglu: That the syllabus is t0-t6
21/04/2025, 12:48 - Parth Bansal: Parth c and d can be derived using energy and momentum conservation u don't need 4 vector
21/04/2025, 12:48 - Om Paglu: Where is 4 vector in this?
21/04/2025, 12:48 - Om Paglu: Haa but the 1st 2 questions were just 4 vectors
21/04/2025, 12:49 - Om Paglu: Atleast those should b dropped na
21/04/2025, 12:49 - Parth Bansal: I agree about part a and part b but part c and d should be kept
21/04/2025, 12:49 - Om Paglu: Haan still ok

25/04/2025, 12:21 - Parth Bansal: Its wrong many a times <This message was edited>
25/04/2025, 12:29 - Om Paglu: Like in that cl pyq,were there any wrong solutions?
25/04/2025, 12:50 - Parth Bansal: Do u have solutions
25/04/2025, 12:53 - Om Paglu: Lol if I had the solutions,why would I ask u
25/04/2025, 12:53 - Om Paglu: I meant after confirming from chatgpt,what do u think?were there any wrong solutions (as given by chatgpt)
25/04/2025, 12:54 - Parth Bansal: Yea in 3 rd question
25/04/2025, 12:54 - Om Paglu: Also,is the last slide coming? transient state one?
25/04/2025, 12:54 - Om Paglu: Accha
25/04/2025, 12:59 - Parth Bansal: Yes
25/04/2025, 19:50 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
25/04/2025, 19:54 - Parth Bansal: So the point you have located is in between two enthalpy deviation lines right
25/04/2025, 19:54 - Parth Bansal: So it's going to be an estimate acc to the values you know
25/04/2025, 19:58 - Om Paglu: But in actual chart,where r those lines given?
25/04/2025, 19:59 - Parth Bansal: In actual chart you have been given some lines
25/04/2025, 20:00 - Parth Bansal: Not all enthalpy deviation lines
25/04/2025, 20:00 - Parth Bansal: Based on the given lines you can get a rough estimate of your exact point <This message was edited>
25/04/2025, 20:06 - Om Paglu: Rnt those specific volume lines??
25/04/2025, 21:17 - Parth Bansal: Wait I will send what is ehat
25/04/2025, 22:48 - Parth Bansal: <Media omitted>
25/04/2025, 22:48 - Parth Bansal: ignore the blue line
25/04/2025, 22:51 - Parth Bansal: line of constant enthalpy is same as that of constant wet blub
25/04/2025, 22:55 - Om Paglu: Haa,vo to pata hain,but I was asking about enthalpy deviation lines
25/04/2025, 23:17 - Parth Bansal: <Media omitted>
25/04/2025, 23:34 - Om Paglu: Accha,got it,thanks

04/05/2025, 22:33 - Parth Bansal: Yea ok man my fault
04/05/2025, 22:33 - Om Paglu: I got in the range of 70-80
04/05/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: In the endsem,in that 12 marks wala question,I got 0😭
04/05/2025, 22:34 - Parth Bansal: Like it matters above or below 75 as that could be grade defining
04/05/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: Oh is it?
04/05/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: What's the average?
04/05/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: Though I was expecting this only 🤣
04/05/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: Idk the avg ta said 85 could be the AA grade
04/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: And ab?
04/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Bb?
04/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Just tell me bb...bcoz i don't expect anything above that
04/05/2025, 22:36 - Parth Bansal: For ab and bb it's generally -10 from 85 and then 75 and so on
04/05/2025, 22:36 - Om Paglu: Since u r getting aa,we want a party on 10th,ok?
04/05/2025, 22:36 - Om Paglu: Ohh

04/05/2025, 22:37 - Om Paglu: Today was rr vs kkr match
04/05/2025, 22:38 - Om Paglu: Is it the final?
04/05/2025, 22:38 - Om Paglu: Or just a guess?
04/05/2025, 22:38 - Parth Bansal: Guess many people think 80 can be the AA cutoff
04/05/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: So,60 for bb?
04/05/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: Makes sense
04/05/2025, 22:40 - Parth Bansal: Yea
04/05/2025, 22:40 - Parth Bansal: So with cutoff u can get ab easily
04/05/2025, 22:40 - Parth Bansal: But like above or below 75
04/05/2025, 22:40 - Om Paglu: I got very very close to 75...75 in limiting sense
04/05/2025, 22:41 - Parth Bansal: Bro just the number dawg it's not that deep
04/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: Really
04/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: I got something in decimals
04/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: 75.654 or something
04/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: Like scaling down everything resulted in decimals
04/05/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: That will be converted
04/05/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: To 76 ez ab
04/05/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: Ohh so like if someone gets say 75.054
04/05/2025, 22:45 - Om Paglu: Then it'll b converted to 75?
04/05/2025, 22:45 - Parth Bansal: Yes
04/05/2025, 22:45 - Om Paglu: Hmm I see
04/05/2025, 22:45 - Parth Bansal: Like it gets rounded iff
04/05/2025, 22:45 - Parth Bansal: Off*
04/05/2025, 22:45 - Om Paglu: So i want a party at Taj,ok?

05/05/2025, 00:17 - Parth Bansal: Fight is ok when prof is not involved
05/05/2025, 00:22 - Om Paglu: What if grading is affected bcoz of 1 mark🥲
05/05/2025, 00:22 - Om Paglu: Anyways,it doesn't matter to u bcoz u r getting 10
05/05/2025, 00:30 - Parth Bansal: Niga what if grading is effected due to a mark then how would I get 10 
Logic ain't logicing

05/05/2025, 00:36 - Om Paglu: Yeah obviously, that's the truth
05/05/2025, 00:36 - Om Paglu: Words of a topper
05/05/2025, 00:36 - Parth Bansal: I prefer development of everyone like I prefer helping and teaching people rather than competing as both of us grow while teaching and learning
05/05/2025, 00:37 - Om Paglu: R u like planning to go for a masters or something?
05/05/2025, 00:37 - Parth Bansal: No not as such

05/05/2025, 00:39 - Parth Bansal: Bro that's not how it works 
Even if i did masters I would only be helping u than be a problem
05/05/2025, 00:41 - Om Paglu: Haa but what if there's only one seat,and we both r competing for it
05/05/2025, 00:42 - Om Paglu: See actually the thing is like since I m in iitb,and I hate it like trash, I just wanna get out of India.So I m too desperate to get selected in masters
05/05/2025, 00:42 - Om Paglu: More than jee adv🤣
05/05/2025, 00:43 - Parth Bansal: Don't worry bro there is less of a chance if me taking a aero course than of u taking a CL masters
05/05/2025, 00:43 - Parth Bansal: Chill out
05/05/2025, 00:44 - Parth Bansal: + don't u like need same UG and OG degree
05/05/2025, 00:44 - Om Paglu: Lol u don't like aero at all

05/05/2025, 00:45 - Parth Bansal: You are up till 1 in ur home also don't your parents like scold u
05/05/2025, 00:45 - Om Paglu: They r sleeping
05/05/2025, 00:46 - Parth Bansal: No I was planning for behaviour economics probability statistics of AI/DS like one elective of each not a minor of anything as such
05/05/2025, 00:46 - Parth Bansal: But like don't they know the time when u go to sleep
05/05/2025, 00:46 - Parth Bansal: See if u sleep at 1:30 then at what time do u wake up
05/05/2025, 00:46 - Om Paglu: Accha so like maths indirectly
05/05/2025, 00:47 - Om Paglu: Not really,they r not that strict.Lile they tell me to sleep within 12:30,but they don't really keep a check on me
05/05/2025, 00:47 - Om Paglu: 8:30
05/05/2025, 00:47 - Om Paglu: Have breakfast
05/05/2025, 00:47 - Om Paglu: And then again Sleep
05/05/2025, 00:47 - Parth Bansal: U can say so like to an extent but it's like applied more than bs abstract linear algebra theory
05/05/2025, 00:48 - Om Paglu: Did u apply for bsds?
05/05/2025, 00:48 - Parth Bansal: How does one apply for that in which clg
05/05/2025, 00:49 - Om Paglu: Nah i meant during jee

05/05/2025, 00:49 - Om Paglu: Like I applied for bstat
05/05/2025, 00:49 - Om Paglu: Shourya applied for bsds
05/05/2025, 00:49 - Parth Bansal: No i didnt really have a preference till jee it's only in clg that I started liking thisbstuff
05/05/2025, 00:50 - Om Paglu: That's actually much better than liking something dearly and not choosing it😭
05/05/2025, 00:50 - Parth Bansal: That's true but what has happened has happened so one should think Abt the future only
05/05/2025, 00:51 - Om Paglu: Hmm, that's what I have started doing these days
05/05/2025, 00:52 - Parth Bansal: Yea it just makes u feel sad and u can do Nthg Abt it .
I also have a story of how royally i fucked up my JEE exam but can't do much
05/05/2025, 00:52 - Om Paglu: U know what I kinda guessed that
05/05/2025, 00:52 - Om Paglu: Like ur iq level doesn't match ur rank at all
05/05/2025, 00:53 - Om Paglu: But who said we can't do anything
05/05/2025, 00:55 - Parth Bansal: Yeaa I mean IQ is a bit different I would say I m better at pattern recognition and what an examiner expects us to learn from their course so basically like I have ideas Abt what can be asked and what not 
It has happened many times that I have told vihaan that learn this subtle for it will come 100 percent and it comes 
But it's more of pattern recognition than IQ
05/05/2025, 00:55 - Om Paglu: What!???! 😦😦
05/05/2025, 00:56 - Om Paglu: U should tell me all the questions from now on
05/05/2025, 00:56 - Parth Bansal: Not all it's like 4 mark only out of 30 like that and more of a general idea of how the paper is gonna look like
05/05/2025, 00:56 - Parth Bansal: Bro we are going to be in different batches
05/05/2025, 00:57 - Om Paglu: Still😢
05/05/2025, 00:57 - Om Paglu: And vihaan?
05/05/2025, 00:57 - Om Paglu: Question paper is different for different batches?
05/05/2025, 00:57 - Parth Bansal: Yea hen is with me only most of the people ik are in S1 only
05/05/2025, 00:57 - Om Paglu: Hen 🤣🤣
05/05/2025, 00:57 - Parth Bansal: Yea every single thing is different prof papers quizzes the number of quizzes grading schemes
05/05/2025, 00:58 - Om Paglu: So in same department, everything is different?
05/05/2025, 00:59 - Om Paglu: I heard grading difficulty level is almost the same
05/05/2025, 00:59 - Om Paglu: But in S1 attendance is compulsory,unlike s2
05/05/2025, 00:59 - Parth Bansal: Yess
05/05/2025, 01:00 - Parth Bansal: I have heard from all the seniors grading is tuffer for S2
05/05/2025, 01:00 - Parth Bansal: He prefers to be called hen but only by me
05/05/2025, 01:00 - Parth Bansal: I don't know Abt that
05/05/2025, 01:01 - Om Paglu: Haa but seniors also said s2 is tough but slightly
05/05/2025, 01:01 - Om Paglu: Like not that much
05/05/2025, 01:02 - Om Paglu: Also this time all genius ppl r in S1,so this time I feel grading will b easier for us
05/05/2025, 01:02 - Parth Bansal: Tuff in which sense grading  only na bcz courses are same
05/05/2025, 01:02 - Om Paglu: Then can I call him cat?
05/05/2025, 01:02 - Om Paglu: Hmm,only grade
05/05/2025, 01:03 - Parth Bansal: Idk u would have to ask him dont mention me pls 🙏 <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: Yeah why will I mention u
05/05/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: Ranit is also in S1 na?
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: Hen bcz Vihaan -> haan -> hen
Idk if cat makes a lot of  sense
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: Ya
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: Ohh lol such logic.
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: Nice.No competition for me at all
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: 😅🤣
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: No niga think Abt it
05/05/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: Ur missing a certain someone
05/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: Not nilay or karan
05/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: They rnt that genius
05/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: And I know how to tackle them
05/05/2025, 01:05 - Parth Bansal: Wow that's just destruction but why do u think so
05/05/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Not destruction 🤣 i meant competing with nilay is easy
05/05/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: And karan as well
05/05/2025, 01:07 - Om Paglu: But with ppl like y'all (like actual genius) is a herculean task
05/05/2025, 01:07 - Om Paglu: Also next year onwards I'll b focusing on aero and maths,so dic courses will b basically for marks,I can't study those for knowledge
05/05/2025, 01:09 - Parth Bansal: Bro like if you try and imagine we will have courses like controls and systems in DIC right 
So what you learn from that course can be applied to aero 
We will have courses related to fluid dynamics in DIC and u must be knowing how related that is to aero 
Also numerical analysis is very general thaN DIX specific I think
05/05/2025, 01:09 - Parth Bansal: So u can find a lot of similarities in ur field and dic
05/05/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: Haa i meant courses which r not related to propulsion
05/05/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: Controls me I have no interest
05/05/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: Aerod and propulsion works for me
05/05/2025, 01:10 - Parth Bansal: But that might help u understand the kinematics of aero
05/05/2025, 01:11 - Parth Bansal: Forward and inverse
05/05/2025, 01:11 - Parth Bansal: Like dic specific lab courses might be useless for you that I agree
05/05/2025, 01:11 - Om Paglu: Maybe,idk have to check what exactly is there
05/05/2025, 01:11 - Om Paglu: Those r trash
05/05/2025, 01:11 - Om Paglu: I was talking about aero controls
05/05/2025, 01:12 - Parth Bansal: Controls is like kinematics don't think it's like controlling aeroplane 
It is controlling the aeroplane but like differently
05/05/2025, 01:13 - Parth Bansal: Like in propulsion how do you keep your rocket stable
05/05/2025, 01:13 - Om Paglu: Yeah yeah I know that
05/05/2025, 01:13 - Parth Bansal: This is a controls problem
05/05/2025, 01:13 - Om Paglu: It involves lots of maths,right?
05/05/2025, 01:14 - Parth Bansal: Yea mega omega chunk of maths
05/05/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Hmm,i was solving a tut once 🤣
05/05/2025, 01:14 - Parth Bansal: Ur dp is aeroplane that says something
05/05/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: No
05/05/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: It's just spoilers and flaps
05/05/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: What's a spoiler
05/05/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: See in my dp the part that's protruded outwards is a spoiler
05/05/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: Basically to spoil the lift
05/05/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: While descending
05/05/2025, 01:17 - Parth Bansal: Ohhh okay got it
05/05/2025, 01:17 - Parth Bansal: Damn the name spoiler is impressive
05/05/2025, 01:17 - Om Paglu: Comes from spoiling lift
05/05/2025, 01:17 - Om Paglu: Bcoz of seperation of flow and high surface area
05/05/2025, 01:18 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
05/05/2025, 01:18 - Parth Bansal: But that doesn't change the fact of your aero love thingy becoz that's like dp <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: Yeah
05/05/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: Supersonic aero is the best i feel
05/05/2025, 01:20 - Parth Bansal: Bro it's just like when you use these terms it's like calculus being presented in front of a 2nd grader
05/05/2025, 01:20 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣
05/05/2025, 01:20 - Parth Bansal: I have no clue whatsoever but like supersonic means fast planes
05/05/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: I meant aero in defence
05/05/2025, 01:21 - Parth Bansal: Like ones which fly at 4-5 machs <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: Hmm like sukhoi and all
05/05/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: Yeah yeah
05/05/2025, 01:21 - Parth Bansal: Hmm I think America has like planes reaching upto 7 machs
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: But unfortunately they won't let me work in their defence 😭
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: Even if I m the best
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Parth Bansal: Americans?
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: Hmm
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Parth Bansal: You want to work for Americans?
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Parth Bansal: Like for their defence
05/05/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: Research in america
05/05/2025, 01:23 - Om Paglu: Wanted to
05/05/2025, 01:23 - Om Paglu: But they won't let me
05/05/2025, 01:23 - Parth Bansal: Wow man thass crazy
05/05/2025, 01:23 - Om Paglu: So no chances😭😭
05/05/2025, 01:23 - Parth Bansal: I respect that but india better
05/05/2025, 01:24 - Om Paglu: India is not that well developed as compared to America in aero
05/05/2025, 01:24 - Om Paglu: +no resources available for iitians to stay
05/05/2025, 01:25 - Om Paglu: And develop it
05/05/2025, 01:25 - Parth Bansal: Even if India is a bit poor its not developed but like if one goes to study in America then whatever one has learnt they must use that to enhance the motherland 
Atleast that's what I feel but hey who am i to say it's just personal choice
05/05/2025, 01:26 - Om Paglu: That's what everyone told me except my parents 🤣
05/05/2025, 01:27 - Om Paglu: And I personally like those American cities,like it's so nice
05/05/2025, 01:27 - Om Paglu: And I m being a racist too...those ppl there🥲
05/05/2025, 01:28 - Parth Bansal: Yea agreed 100% but only until you have not spent a month there after a month everything becomes normal only
05/05/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: Just imagine u staying with those Europeans, isn't it tooooo nice
05/05/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: Maybe,in that case I'll come back🤣
05/05/2025, 01:28 - Parth Bansal: What no way you just said that thass crazy
05/05/2025, 01:29 - Parth Bansal: My parents have been to Europe quite a few times They still prefer my home town only idk why
05/05/2025, 01:29 - Om Paglu: Ik but just imagine
05/05/2025, 01:30 - Om Paglu: Maybe it's personal choice,like my parents prefer indians over Europeans as well
05/05/2025, 01:30 - Parth Bansal: Yea
05/05/2025, 01:30 - Om Paglu: Won't it b crazzyyy

05/05/2025, 01:33 - Parth Bansal: Umm that's just a matter of personal preference but in general Yeahh 199% agreed
05/05/2025, 01:33 - Om Paglu: Another major problem in india
05/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: Is like in bengal, it's difficult to communicate with shopkeepers
05/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: Bcoz many don't understand english
05/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: Now to I can communicate in Hindi properly
05/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: But earlier it was really a problem
05/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: Especially cleaners
05/05/2025, 01:35 - Parth Bansal: Ohh that's nice but some Europeans also won't understand English in case ur wondering
05/05/2025, 01:35 - Om Paglu: Lol,then I'll teach them hindi🥲
05/05/2025, 01:35 - Parth Bansal: Language barrier is a genuine thing 
So what all languages do u know now

05/05/2025, 01:50 - Om Paglu: Mamta bengal k ek prokar noshto kore dicche🤣
05/05/2025, 01:51 - Om Paglu: Hmm a bit, except the ascent
05/05/2025, 01:51 - Parth Bansal: Mamta will destroy bengal in every bit
05/05/2025, 01:52 - Om Paglu: Almost correct
05/05/2025, 01:52 - Om Paglu: Try again
05/05/2025, 01:52 - Om Paglu: U r almost there
05/05/2025, 01:52 - Parth Bansal: Mamta will destroy bengal in someway or the other
05/05/2025, 01:52 - Om Paglu: Mamta is destroying
05/05/2025, 01:52 - Om Paglu: Rest is correct
05/05/2025, 01:53 - Om Paglu: Bcoz she really is destroying everyday
05/05/2025, 01:53 - Parth Bansal: See now it's getting a bit grammatical I would say I'm not an experienced practitioner
05/05/2025, 01:53 - Om Paglu: But how? it's very difficult
05/05/2025, 01:53 - Om Paglu: I mean bengali is very difficult
05/05/2025, 01:54 - Om Paglu: For me
05/05/2025, 01:54 - Om Paglu: Completely different from english
05/05/2025, 01:54 - Om Paglu: Hindi is still ok
05/05/2025, 01:54 - Parth Bansal: It's ezz you just gotta trust

05/05/2025, 02:08 - Om Paglu: She's very lucky to have a brother like u
05/05/2025, 02:09 - Om Paglu: Depression wala time
05/05/2025, 02:09 - Parth Bansal: No she is just a chill human out of this rat race in a peaceful world of humanities
05/05/2025, 02:09 - Om Paglu: That's the best
05/05/2025, 02:09 - Om Paglu: Tell her to take aero,and if she needs connections in future,I can help her
05/05/2025, 02:09 - Parth Bansal: Does your sister have any aim in particular or does she just love studying
05/05/2025, 02:10 - Parth Bansal: Bro aero is engg and she is not interested
05/05/2025, 02:10 - Om Paglu: She used to aim for jee
05/05/2025, 02:10 - Parth Bansal: Used meaning even before 9th
05/05/2025, 02:10 - Parth Bansal: When were u in depression
05/05/2025, 02:10 - Om Paglu: But after my depression she started aiming for everything other than jee
05/05/2025, 02:10 - Om Paglu: 1st sem
05/05/2025, 02:11 - Parth Bansal: Srsly?
05/05/2025, 02:11 - Parth Bansal: Like serious depression
05/05/2025, 02:11 - Om Paglu: Yeah,what else did u think
05/05/2025, 02:11 - Parth Bansal: U didn't seem depressed when I talked to u in first sem
05/05/2025, 02:11 - Parth Bansal: U were like happy only
05/05/2025, 02:11 - Om Paglu: I had regular suicidal thoughts
05/05/2025, 02:12 - Om Paglu: Isn't that the difference between depression and sadness
05/05/2025, 02:12 - Om Paglu: Depression is when u r on the verge of quitting and u pretend as if u r happy
05/05/2025, 02:13 - Parth Bansal: What ain't no way bro thats scary i don't even know what to say but what I can say I biral if you need help u can talk to me
05/05/2025, 02:13 - Om Paglu: Umm thanks,but I m already in the recovery phase
05/05/2025, 02:13 - Parth Bansal: Hmm yea but like some signs tell the person I'm talking is going thru smth
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Om Paglu: I just lost hopes
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Parth Bansal: That's great
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Parth Bansal: Ohh was that like the last ohase
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Om Paglu: Like when u r too much depressed u'll feel like no one will understand u
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Om Paglu: When I went for therapies
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Om Paglu: They said why didn't u come earlier
05/05/2025, 02:14 - Parth Bansal: And one after that like one doesn't even bother like trying to express oneself to other <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 02:15 - Om Paglu: So immediately I came back home to Apollo <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 02:15 - Om Paglu: Obviously not
05/05/2025, 02:15 - Om Paglu: Bcoz one can't just forgive himself/herself for the past mistake
05/05/2025, 02:16 - Om Paglu: But fortunately the therapies worked a lot
05/05/2025, 02:16 - Parth Bansal: So if you have time and you are comfortable expressing I'm genuinely interested to know what goes thru ones mind when they think the decision they took was really bad
05/05/2025, 02:17 - Om Paglu: Yeah why won't I b comfortable
05/05/2025, 02:18 - Parth Bansal: Like if one is not they might not want to recall their oast traumatic times
05/05/2025, 02:18 - Om Paglu: Like in the initial stages councelling works,after that ur hormones start affecting in such a way that medication is necessary
05/05/2025, 02:18 - Om Paglu: Nah it's ok
05/05/2025, 02:18 - Om Paglu: So if u find someone in the initial stages,send them to therapy
05/05/2025, 02:19 - Parth Bansal: Like what all happens 
Like if I think I took a really bad decision then I think not much can be done and move on but like I'm interested to know what happens when one can't get over
05/05/2025, 02:19 - Om Paglu: Like ppl can't forgive themselves for their past mistake, don't really know how to take the next step
05/05/2025, 02:19 - Om Paglu: Always anxious
05/05/2025, 02:19 - Om Paglu: But in front of ppl,try to hide everything
05/05/2025, 02:20 - Parth Bansal: So how is there day say when you went to classes did u like try to listen
05/05/2025, 02:20 - Om Paglu: Like initially they'll open up,but in my case no one gave me good suggestions
05/05/2025, 02:20 - Om Paglu: So it kept on increasing
05/05/2025, 02:21 - Om Paglu: And prolonged exposure for a period of around 2-3 months made things worse
05/05/2025, 02:21 - Om Paglu: Classes?
05/05/2025, 02:22 - Parth Bansal: Ohh like I feel making fun of their trauma might kick in the depression effect as people are generally insensitive 
So what do you think how bad is like people making fun of someone's trauma <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 02:22 - Parth Bansal: Yea
05/05/2025, 02:22 - Om Paglu: See the thing is that since class 9 I was like I'll study aero at iitm only.and I liked it a lot,then I got the rank too.But seperation after that seemed to ruin everything for me
05/05/2025, 02:23 - Om Paglu: I didn't find a way out
05/05/2025, 02:23 - Parth Bansal: Seperation?
05/05/2025, 02:23 - Om Paglu: It has a very very negative impact.Like few days ago one of my friend unknowingly said something about chemical and aero related to me,and I felt like slapping him
05/05/2025, 02:24 - Om Paglu: Matlab not taking aero
05/05/2025, 02:24 - Om Paglu: Though whatever he said wasn't directly related to my past trauma
05/05/2025, 02:24 - Parth Bansal: So it adds up and one is unable to forgive themselves for their decisions
05/05/2025, 02:24 - Om Paglu: Accha u mean therapy session?
05/05/2025, 02:25 - Om Paglu: Yeah
05/05/2025, 02:25 - Parth Bansal: Classes like IIT lectures
05/05/2025, 02:25 - Om Paglu: Accha🤣🤣
05/05/2025, 02:25 - Om Paglu: In 1st sem to i couldn't focus at all
05/05/2025, 02:25 - Om Paglu: Not even the slides before exam
05/05/2025, 02:26 - Parth Bansal: Hmm like in your own world thinking Abt why this happened to me only what did I do wrong from where did it go all downhill
05/05/2025, 02:26 - Om Paglu: Yeah brain full of all these things only
05/05/2025, 02:27 - Om Paglu: Sometimes it used to hurt so much
05/05/2025, 02:27 - Om Paglu: That I used to physically hurt myself to get relief from the mental pain
05/05/2025, 02:27 - Parth Bansal: Does like in these cases opening to parents how was that like
05/05/2025, 02:28 - Om Paglu: My dad's a doctor
05/05/2025, 02:28 - Om Paglu: So he understood it was a case where medical help is absolutely necessary
05/05/2025, 02:28 - Om Paglu: But he said i should have told them earlier
05/05/2025, 02:28 - Om Paglu: Then it shouldn't have escalated so much
05/05/2025, 02:29 - Om Paglu: It's not some lgbtqia+ that opening up would be difficult 😂😂
05/05/2025, 02:30 - Parth Bansal: So from then onwards I was happy inly
05/05/2025, 02:30 - Om Paglu: Like even any other things won't hurt u
05/05/2025, 02:31 - Parth Bansal: That's a W
05/05/2025, 02:31 - Om Paglu: When I told my parents,like in the initial stages they said don't worry much,pursue a masters and PhD in chemical,afterall chemical is better than aero
05/05/2025, 02:31 - Om Paglu: And that added to my depression even more
05/05/2025, 02:32 - Parth Bansal: In my case the thing was i had just put in too much effort to see the result i saw like I studied 12 hrs daily for more than 2 yrs
05/05/2025, 02:32 - Om Paglu: Good for u
05/05/2025, 02:33 - Om Paglu: Tbh,I was somehow confident that I'll get aero rank,so i didn't study hard at all
05/05/2025, 02:33 - Om Paglu: During jee time I wasted a lot of time on other stuffs
05/05/2025, 02:33 - Parth Bansal: Yea that could be one thing because no one knows how the victim is feeling and how there brain is oriented towards what they felt was truly beautiful
05/05/2025, 02:34 - Om Paglu: Yeah after they said this my sadness increased manifold
05/05/2025, 02:34 - Parth Bansal: But like u did get the rank right
05/05/2025, 02:34 - Om Paglu: I got a rank in 4ks.  And for aero female in all colleges closing is around 6k
05/05/2025, 02:35 - Parth Bansal: So if u don't mind where did it all go wrong
05/05/2025, 02:35 - Om Paglu: But now I feel this whole depression taught a very important lesson
05/05/2025, 02:35 - Om Paglu: Depression??
05/05/2025, 02:35 - Parth Bansal: No like if the rank was right did u mess up josaa
05/05/2025, 02:36 - Om Paglu: Ohh hmm,all mistakes in josaa
05/05/2025, 02:36 - Parth Bansal: Yea that shit is just too hard
05/05/2025, 02:36 - Om Paglu: Hmm
05/05/2025, 02:36 - Om Paglu: I even left isi for aero
05/05/2025, 02:36 - Parth Bansal: There are so many rules
05/05/2025, 02:36 - Om Paglu: Else I would have taken isi only
05/05/2025, 02:37 - Om Paglu: If aero didn't exist
05/05/2025, 02:37 - Parth Bansal: Isi like you love maths more or physics more
05/05/2025, 02:37 - Om Paglu: Maths obvio
05/05/2025, 02:37 - Parth Bansal: Bro aero is more phy than maths
05/05/2025, 02:37 - Om Paglu: Yeah ik that
05/05/2025, 02:38 - Om Paglu: But it's not that I dislike phy
05/05/2025, 02:38 - Om Paglu: I like classical physics too much
05/05/2025, 02:38 - Parth Bansal: Oh got it you hate the quantum bs <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 02:38 - Om Paglu: But phy as a whole(quantum and all)I don't really like those
05/05/2025, 02:38 - Om Paglu: Yeah
05/05/2025, 02:39 - Parth Bansal: Do u like wave theory like em waves and electrodynamic as whole
05/05/2025, 02:39 - Om Paglu: Nah
05/05/2025, 02:39 - Om Paglu: I just like solid mechanics,fluids,thermod
05/05/2025, 02:39 - Om Paglu: So classical mechanics
05/05/2025, 02:39 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
05/05/2025, 02:40 - Parth Bansal: So how long does it take for one to generally recover
05/05/2025, 02:40 - Om Paglu: Depends on the stage of depression
05/05/2025, 02:40 - Parth Bansal: After going through this level of depression
05/05/2025, 02:40 - Om Paglu: Mine was MDD
05/05/2025, 02:40 - Parth Bansal: MDD?
05/05/2025, 02:40 - Om Paglu: Major depression disorder
05/05/2025, 02:41 - Om Paglu: So yeah I started getting the effects after 2 weeks
05/05/2025, 02:41 - Parth Bansal: After 2 weeks of what like therapy?
05/05/2025, 02:41 - Om Paglu: And somewhat recovery say 2-3 months
05/05/2025, 02:41 - Om Paglu: Drugs
05/05/2025, 02:42 - Parth Bansal: Ohh so what are those drugs like what do they do to your body
05/05/2025, 02:42 - Om Paglu: But doctor said to continue the same dose for 6 months,after which it's going to reduce
05/05/2025, 02:42 - Om Paglu: Like for proper recovery say around a year
05/05/2025, 02:42 - Om Paglu: Those maintain the hormonal balance
05/05/2025, 02:43 - Parth Bansal: What kind of hormones peak during that time
05/05/2025, 02:43 - Om Paglu: Like in MDD all hormones get imbalanced,so these anti depressant drugs restore level to normal
05/05/2025, 02:43 - Om Paglu: I m not a doctor 😅
05/05/2025, 02:44 - Parth Bansal: Also what do they do in therapy like they talk for an hour
05/05/2025, 02:44 - Om Paglu: But yeah I observed the effect in almost all physical activities
05/05/2025, 02:44 - Om Paglu: Yeah but it wasn't that effective for me
05/05/2025, 02:44 - Parth Bansal: Which *effect*
05/05/2025, 02:44 - Om Paglu: Bcoz it reached the level of MDD
05/05/2025, 02:45 - Parth Bansal: Like they try to convince you in a very subtle manner or what like they try to be friends with u?
05/05/2025, 02:46 - Om Paglu: Decrease in energy, changes in Sleep pattern, craving only for chocolates and nothing else, fluctuations in body weight,hair fall...
05/05/2025, 02:46 - Om Paglu: Yeah as if they r our best friends with whom we can share everything
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Parth Bansal: Ohh so in general I'm assuming the victim would sleep less than usual
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Om Paglu: Nah it depends on ppl
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Om Paglu: Usually ppl tend to have less Sleep
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Om Paglu: But I slept for more than 11 hours😅
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Parth Bansal: Due to anxiety
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Parth Bansal: Woahh
05/05/2025, 02:47 - Om Paglu: Hmm
05/05/2025, 02:48 - Om Paglu: See in mental health,u can't really assume bcoz it's way complicated than physical health
05/05/2025, 02:49 - Parth Bansal: Like you said u would physically harm yourself so that u would not feel mentally burdened or less mentally burdened than physically burdened
05/05/2025, 02:49 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
05/05/2025, 02:49 - Om Paglu: That's common ig,bcoz during this time mental pain was too much
05/05/2025, 02:49 - Om Paglu: Difficult to explain
05/05/2025, 02:50 - Om Paglu: I don't know how i survived the whole situation
05/05/2025, 02:50 - Om Paglu: Can't really believe I m turning 19 soon.
05/05/2025, 02:50 - Parth Bansal: Like how hard do people go on themselves for

05/05/2025, 02:57 - Om Paglu: That's what I asked na? what's formal hindi?
05/05/2025, 02:57 - Om Paglu: I just understand whatever everyone speaks

05/05/2025, 03:03 - Om Paglu: Yeah that's why I said na ... wait for the cpi to be declared,and while saying this there's a bit of uncertainty
05/05/2025, 03:03 - Om Paglu: And it's me who's just flexing about ur cpi
05/05/2025, 03:04 - Om Paglu: And u don't want me to ask for a party before the cpi is declared
05/05/2025, 03:04 - Parth Bansal: I was asking so that I can know how to express myself because u might not understand the true emotion behind a informal hindi sentence
05/05/2025, 03:04 - Parth Bansal: Yea definitely after cpi no problem but not before you know
05/05/2025, 03:05 - Om Paglu: Then same goes with u

05/05/2025, 03:07 - Om Paglu: I meant u shouldn't b asking even on 9th,bcoz who knows whether I'll b alive on 10th?
05/05/2025, 03:07 - Om Paglu: In all 3
05/05/2025, 03:07 - Parth Bansal: More like you can express true emotions in English as it s your first language

05/05/2025, 03:26 - Om Paglu: https://youtu.be/3z8hYf59T80?si=n1j1Nm4pda3dGsXO

05/05/2025, 03:28 - Parth Bansal: Bro that's not ur clg that's only a project
05/05/2025, 03:29 - Om Paglu: Nah that's my alma mater
05/05/2025, 03:29 - Parth Bansal: Wow
05/05/2025, 03:29 - Parth Bansal: I don't think that could be
05/05/2025, 03:30 - Om Paglu: IITM>>>>>>IITB
05/05/2025, 03:30 - Parth Bansal: Reality is different and one is better off living in reality I get it you wanted IITM and IITM is worlds better but the matter of fact won't change what can change is our way of looking at stuff
05/05/2025, 03:31 - Parth Bansal: It's not the clg that's special it is us who make the place special
05/05/2025, 03:31 - Om Paglu: Hmm,it has already been a year,since haven't been able to like iitb even a bit
05/05/2025, 03:31 - Om Paglu: Trying my best
05/05/2025, 03:32 - Parth Bansal: Becoz you are perceiving the world through the glasses of your past and your past imagined being in IITM so it's natural
05/05/2025, 03:32 - Om Paglu: Yeah makes sense
05/05/2025, 03:32 - Om Paglu: But I m super excited for iitm
05/05/2025, 03:32 - Om Paglu: My dream college
05/05/2025, 03:33 - Om Paglu: Since class 9
05/05/2025, 03:33 - Om Paglu: 🥳🥳
05/05/2025, 03:34 - Parth Bansal: Yea I'm also happy for u u will get to go there but the problem is if you love the place too much then it will again be difficult for you to adjust in 3 rd sem potentially ruining your 3 rd sem also 
So try to see IITM as your workplace other wise if u fall in love with that clg it would be difficult
05/05/2025, 03:35 - Om Paglu: Hmm shit i didn't think about that
05/05/2025, 03:35 - Om Paglu: I m just waiting for my convo

06/05/2025, 01:26 - Om Paglu: Reynolds transport theorem
06/05/2025, 01:27 - Parth Bansal: Yea ezz if you want i can tell you solutions to navier stokes equation
06/05/2025, 01:27 - Parth Bansal: Also like not everybody gets to do a oroject
06/05/2025, 01:27 - Parth Bansal: So yea demands from student must be high
06/05/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: Hmm, especially 3rdies r preferred
06/05/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: Ignoring viscosity or considering coefficient of viscosity?
06/05/2025, 01:29 - Parth Bansal: Without ignoring anything
06/05/2025, 01:29 - Om Paglu: Yeah u just need to make the prof believe that u r highly dedicated and u know the basics
06/05/2025, 01:30 - Parth Bansal: Bro like u r
06/05/2025, 01:31 - Om Paglu: I m a donkey??

06/05/2025, 01:32 - Om Paglu: Towards aero a bit
06/05/2025, 01:32 - Parth Bansal: Good good
06/05/2025, 01:33 - Parth Bansal: I still haven't discovered my passion yet
06/05/2025, 01:33 - Parth Bansal: unlike u
06/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: That's nice na
06/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: U can explore a lot of new things
06/05/2025, 01:34 - Om Paglu: Unlike me🥲
06/05/2025, 01:35 - Parth Bansal: But kab tak exploring
06/05/2025, 01:35 - Om Paglu: It's never too late to stop exploring
06/05/2025, 01:35 - Parth Bansal: There is like a sweet spot between how much to explore and time of finding real passion
06/05/2025, 01:35 - Om Paglu: Hmm,true
06/05/2025, 01:36 - Parth Bansal: And why not explore in the field which you like the most
06/05/2025, 01:36 - Parth Bansal: Than randomly exploring all things simultaneously
06/05/2025, 01:36 - Om Paglu: Yeah that's better...like in 9th standard i realised I was more interested in aero...now I can explore my specific interests
06/05/2025, 01:37 - Om Paglu: Which is even more complicated 🥲
06/05/2025, 01:37 - Om Paglu: What to take... propulsion or aerod?aero or astro?
06/05/2025, 01:38 - Parth Bansal: Yess that's what I wanna be at that stage
I still havent decided whether to do core or nocore like basic stuff
06/05/2025, 01:38 - Om Paglu: Lol,in the vacation u should decide... that's what our TA said
06/05/2025, 01:38 - Om Paglu: Else it'll end in an infinite loop
06/05/2025, 01:39 - Parth Bansal: which ta
06/05/2025, 01:40 - Om Paglu: Maths
06/05/2025, 01:40 - Om Paglu: The day when u were absent
06/05/2025, 01:40 - Parth Bansal: Ohh why did everything important happen on the day when I was absent
06/05/2025, 01:40 - Parth Bansal: Like treat

06/05/2025, 01:41 - Om Paglu: Like this
06/05/2025, 01:41 - Parth Bansal: What all important things you can recall?
06/05/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: And he also said in the vacation u should atleast know what the courses r about,say like there's a craze for ds250
06/05/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: So before taking it, atleast make sure it'll suit u
06/05/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: Else u have to leave it
06/05/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: Like this happened to many ppl
06/05/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: In *minor
06/05/2025, 01:43 - Parth Bansal: Ohh yeah people follow craze rather than their interest
06/05/2025, 01:43 - Parth Bansal: That's what happens with CS in JEE
06/05/2025, 01:43 - Om Paglu: Yeah and then he said about summer projects as well...like many ppl leave it in between
06/05/2025, 01:43 - Om Paglu: Yeah and aero as well
06/05/2025, 01:43 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
06/05/2025, 01:44 - Om Paglu: And I don't remember whether it was maths or phy ta,but ta said before 2nd year starts u must b sure about what exactly u want in life
06/05/2025, 01:45 - Om Paglu: Like trying to keep all options open will become very risky
06/05/2025, 01:45 - Parth Bansal: That's crazy I'm as confused as I was a year ago
06/05/2025, 01:46 - Om Paglu: But how??I mean not only u,most ppl say the same
06/05/2025, 01:46 - Om Paglu: Like since class 9,I was sure about my goals
06/05/2025, 01:46 - Om Paglu: Yeah not exactly sure whether defence or space,but still
06/05/2025, 01:46 - Om Paglu: That's why I took up a project which is related to both😂😂
06/05/2025, 01:47 - Parth Bansal: Yea some find their passion really easily than others
In 9th i only played games
06/05/2025, 01:47 - Om Paglu: I too didn't take studies seriously,but still atleast i understood what exactly i wanted in life
06/05/2025, 01:47 - Parth Bansal: Yea that's good
06/05/2025, 01:48 - Om Paglu: And in 9th,i watched movies a lot😂

06/05/2025, 01:49 - Parth Bansal: Ohh how come I didn't think of that
06/05/2025, 01:49 - Parth Bansal: It was easy to guess
06/05/2025, 01:49 - Om Paglu: And guess the other one
06/05/2025, 01:49 - Om Paglu: I m damn sure u won't b able to

06/05/2025, 01:51 - Parth Bansal: Haven't seen that one
06/05/2025, 01:51 - Om Paglu: That's even better
06/05/2025, 01:51 - Parth Bansal: Interstellar-> dangal crazy personality switch
06/05/2025, 01:51 - Om Paglu: U think I like only aero and nothing else?

06/05/2025, 01:57 - Parth Bansal: I forgot i have been going to gym for 2.5 months without breaking

06/05/2025, 01:59 - Om Paglu: Guess mine
06/05/2025, 01:59 - Parth Bansal: Can you tell me your height
06/05/2025, 01:59 - Om Paglu: 5'4"
06/05/2025, 01:59 - Parth Bansal: 52
06/05/2025, 02:00 - Om Paglu: Na,very close
06/05/2025, 02:00 - Om Paglu: 50
06/05/2025, 02:00 - Om Paglu: That's why my parents scold me almost everyday
06/05/2025, 02:01 - Parth Bansal: Both our guesses were 2 kgs off 
See while writing the above line I realised what I mainly do is finding pattern only
06/05/2025, 02:01 - Parth Bansal: But like what your ideal bodywt?
06/05/2025, 02:02 - Om Paglu: Dad says it should b above 56
06/05/2025, 02:02 - Om Paglu: But I want to b a skeleton
06/05/2025, 02:02 - Om Paglu: So i want say 45
06/05/2025, 02:03 - Om Paglu: Just like hen
06/05/2025, 02:03 - Parth Bansal: I think current wt is best 45 would be dangerous say if u fall sick then your body doesn't even a tiny bit of fat to extract energy from and 56 is like a bit high coz bmi
06/05/2025, 02:03 - Parth Bansal: Lmao ded hen roasted hen is below 50 btw

07/05/2025, 01:53 - Parth Bansal: No man not this again
07/05/2025, 01:53 - Parth Bansal: Then what happened
07/05/2025, 01:53 - Om Paglu: Then I realised single life is the best
07/05/2025, 01:53 - Om Paglu: Long distance 😢
07/05/2025, 01:54 - Parth Bansal: Like did he cheat or what?
07/05/2025, 01:54 - Om Paglu: Nah,he wanted more time from me,while I wanted more time to focus on personal development
07/05/2025, 01:54 - Parth Bansal: So you guys broke up
07/05/2025, 01:54 - Om Paglu: So frequent quarrels
07/05/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: Yeah...he did
07/05/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: Then I realised I m not ready for relationships
07/05/2025, 01:55 - Parth Bansal: Did you want to break up
07/05/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: And single life is the best
07/05/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: Yeah
07/05/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: Like actually it was a coincident
07/05/2025, 01:56 - Parth Bansal: Hmm that might be the case if one wants time for themselves and can't give time to their partner then yes
07/05/2025, 01:56 - Om Paglu: The day when I called him to end everything,he too had the same thoughts😂
07/05/2025, 01:56 - Om Paglu: That's why we should b single till atleast 45 years
07/05/2025, 01:57 - Parth Bansal: Like generally people say this like if you say that you wanna break up then if he is not happy then he will also say yeah yeah
07/05/2025, 01:57 - Parth Bansal: Even if he wanted you
07/05/2025, 01:57 - Parth Bansal: Lmao ded then toh fir kya hi fayda
07/05/2025, 01:57 - Om Paglu: Whatever,but he said first
07/05/2025, 01:57 - Parth Bansal: Ohh is that so
07/05/2025, 01:57 - Om Paglu: Hmm,and then I agreed asap
07/05/2025, 01:58 - Parth Bansal: After 45 it takes the fun part out of it
07/05/2025, 01:58 - Om Paglu: Start dating at 45 and marriage at 60
07/05/2025, 01:58 - Om Paglu: Best life
07/05/2025, 01:58 - Om Paglu: Isn't it?
07/05/2025, 01:58 - Om Paglu: Hen uld also agree
07/05/2025, 01:59 - Parth Bansal: You are a psychopath why would you wanna date someone at 45 and why do you think someone would date a 45 yr old
What do you think
07/05/2025, 01:59 - Om Paglu: See that's not what usually happens
07/05/2025, 01:59 - Om Paglu: But I m saying
07/05/2025, 01:59 - Om Paglu: That's the appropriate time
07/05/2025, 01:59 - Parth Bansal: Hen would never agree acc to hen he told date 16-30 get married 31
07/05/2025, 02:00 - Om Paglu: Lol even my parents weren't married at 31🤣🤣
07/05/2025, 02:00 - Parth Bansal: Nahh coz men's hormones are ded by that time he would not wanna date a 45 yr old
07/05/2025, 02:00 - Om Paglu: We should control hormones,not let hormones control us
07/05/2025, 02:00 - Parth Bansal: Like were they dating at 31
07/05/2025, 02:00 - Om Paglu: Yeah
07/05/2025, 02:01 - Parth Bansal: That's not how it is 
It's a biological fact
07/05/2025, 02:01 - Om Paglu: F**k biology
07/05/2025, 02:01 - Om Paglu: We should think mathematically
07/05/2025, 02:01 - Parth Bansal: I'm telling you a men at 45 is likely to date a 25 yr old than 45
07/05/2025, 02:01 - Om Paglu: Varna be single forever
07/05/2025, 02:02 - Om Paglu: I mean that's the best
07/05/2025, 02:02 - Om Paglu: No problem,easy for me to b single
07/05/2025, 02:03 - Parth Bansal: Yea living life alone self development for what if you can't find a loving caring partner with whom you can share everything
07/05/2025, 02:03 - Parth Bansal: Every one has to die one day
07/05/2025, 02:03 - Om Paglu: For one we need to sacrifice the other
07/05/2025, 02:03 - Om Paglu: And I choose the 1st one
07/05/2025, 02:05 - Parth Bansal: Nahh I think they can be done simultaneously
It's just that you have to divide things into slots like how much time you wanna put to self development you can't be developing yourself every hour in the remaining time just hangout with your partner
07/05/2025, 02:05 - Om Paglu: Exactly that's my point..so we need to do something so that the world remembers us after our death,and for doing something we need to develop ourselves first
07/05/2025, 02:05 - Om Paglu: No,like I meant say if u want a noble prize
07/05/2025, 02:05 - Parth Bansal: Why do you want the world to remember you after your death you wouldn't know
07/05/2025, 02:06 - Parth Bansal: Do u think all noble prize winners are single?
07/05/2025, 02:06 - Parth Bansal: Marrie and Pierre Curie were couples
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Parth Bansal: They both were awarded noble prize
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Om Paglu: Then I'll b able to consider that I have fulfilled the reasons I was sent here
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Om Paglu: Obviously not
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Parth Bansal: They helped develop each other
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Om Paglu: It's a personal choice
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Om Paglu: Maybe from my past experience,I m scared
07/05/2025, 02:07 - Om Paglu: Atleast in college life to i won't b dating for sure...no long distance
07/05/2025, 02:08 - Parth Bansal: Yea that's what I think
Chiz i have seen many people help each other and grow together
07/05/2025, 02:08 - Om Paglu: But in my case it just pulled me down
07/05/2025, 02:08 - Parth Bansal: Yea it depends on chemistry with each other
07/05/2025, 02:08 - Om Paglu: But since u r against single life,why don't u start dating
07/05/2025, 02:09 - Om Paglu: Maybe.Or maybe that I m not ready rn
07/05/2025, 02:09 - Parth Bansal: Man it's difficult to find someone who u truly like
07/05/2025, 02:09 - Parth Bansal: I don't wanna fuck around
07/05/2025, 02:09 - Om Paglu: Yeah true
07/05/2025, 02:10 - Parth Bansal: So the answer is skill issue
07/05/2025, 02:10 - Om Paglu: See at the age of 45,if I m single and not married,then I'll give u a party in Switzerland
07/05/2025, 02:10 - Om Paglu: I promise
07/05/2025, 02:10 - Om Paglu: Else u
07/05/2025, 02:10 - Parth Bansal: Bro i 100% won't be single by 45
07/05/2025, 02:11 - Om Paglu: I told about myself
07/05/2025, 02:11 - Om Paglu: I

07/05/2025, 02:12 - Om Paglu: So,if I m single, I'll
07/05/2025, 02:12 - Parth Bansal: I think in favor for both of us to not be single by 45 coz then L life
07/05/2025, 02:12 - Om Paglu: 99%i'll b single only
07/05/2025, 02:13 - Om Paglu: My parents r ok with me being single
07/05/2025, 02:13 - Parth Bansal: Did u ask them?
07/05/2025, 02:13 - Om Paglu: Like we were just having a random conversation
07/05/2025, 02:14 - Parth Bansal: Wow gud for you but like you are missing out on once in a lifetime experience one might not get other human life
07/05/2025, 02:14 - Parth Bansal: Wow that's good then no restrictions at all
07/05/2025, 02:14 - Om Paglu: And I don't really want that experience
07/05/2025, 02:15 - Om Paglu: They're like do whatever u feel like but try to b the best in ur career

11/05/2025, 22:31 - Parth Bansal: I'm not getting what you are trying to imply
11/05/2025, 22:32 - Om Paglu: Since he's so passionate,ppl will find this attractive,So he was supposed to have a gf
11/05/2025, 22:32 - Om Paglu: But I feel he rejected everyone
11/05/2025, 22:33 - Parth Bansal: Bro ur in your own world what that's not how things work
11/05/2025, 22:33 - Om Paglu: See i as a person would prefer this kind of ppl
11/05/2025, 22:34 - Parth Bansal: Yea but your thought process is really rare
11/05/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: Just like Om
11/05/2025, 22:34 - Parth Bansal: That's not generally how people are they are passionate only about making money not about topics
11/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: So which category do u prefer?
11/05/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: For me
11/05/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: I never really thought about it
11/05/2025, 22:36 - Om Paglu: Ohh that's even better
11/05/2025, 22:36 - Parth Bansal: I want driven women that's a good trait
11/05/2025, 22:36 - Parth Bansal: But that's not one of the topmost priority
11/05/2025, 22:36 - Parth Bansal: Is what I'm saying
11/05/2025, 22:36 - Om Paglu: But u see, since I brought the topic of gf,i should complete it
11/05/2025, 22:37 - Om Paglu: Girls generally prefer guys who r passionate like Om
11/05/2025, 22:37 - Parth Bansal: Wow didn't know that
11/05/2025, 22:37 - Om Paglu: Like a guy with a PhD degree more than someone with btech+millionaire
11/05/2025, 22:37 - Om Paglu: U should
11/05/2025, 22:38 - Parth Bansal: Are u sure?
11/05/2025, 22:38 - Parth Bansal: Btech + millionaire must have also been passionate Abt something
11/05/2025, 22:38 - Om Paglu: Bro I m a girl,so i can understand girls psychology
11/05/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: Oof not really millionaire,i meant a very high paying job,not a CEO 😅
11/05/2025, 22:39 - Parth Bansal: PhDs might not be driven see if someone doesn't get a job after BTech so to not embarrass themselves they just take up higher studies
11/05/2025, 22:40 - Om Paglu: Haa, that's why I explicitly mentioned "someone like Om"
11/05/2025, 22:40 - Om Paglu: Even if not the degree,but passion is very important
11/05/2025, 22:40 - Parth Bansal: Yea but this quality that you are talking about is very rare 
And being in a relationship is not really that rare
11/05/2025, 22:41 - Parth Bansal: But I get your point
11/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: Yeah exactly... that's what I couldn't understand till now
11/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: I personally hate those guys
11/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: But they r in majority
11/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: So how come dating is so common for them
11/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: R they dating trans or what🤣🤣

11/05/2025, 22:43 - Parth Bansal: This definitely won't help
11/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: *and me
11/05/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: I was asking for real cues
11/05/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: I uld say stay single as long as possible
11/05/2025, 22:45 - Om Paglu: U'll find someone at the right time
11/05/2025, 22:45 - Parth Bansal: Nahh u don't randomly find someone walking down the street
11/05/2025, 22:45 - Om Paglu: Tell Hen to b like Om since he's after girls 🤣
11/05/2025, 22:46 - Parth Bansal: Nahh hen is not interested he is a hunter actively looking for prey
11/05/2025, 22:46 - Om Paglu: U'll find someone with the same vibe at the right time, place
11/05/2025, 22:46 - Om Paglu: Maybe in ur workplace
11/05/2025, 22:47 - Om Paglu: Om is completely opposite
11/05/2025, 22:47 - Parth Bansal: That's crazy what do you think about two 16y/o s dating?
11/05/2025, 22:47 - Om Paglu: See according to what I have seen since date
11/05/2025, 22:48 - Om Paglu: It's difficult
11/05/2025, 22:48 - Parth Bansal: What's difficult?
11/05/2025, 22:48 - Om Paglu: Bcoz in 16 years,ppl really don't know what they want in life
11/05/2025, 22:48 - Om Paglu: Their life goals
11/05/2025, 22:49 - Parth Bansal: So they are dating what do u think abt that 
Good or bad
11/05/2025, 22:49 - Om Paglu: Bad
11/05/2025, 22:49 - Parth Bansal: Hmm yea that's what I think
11/05/2025, 22:50 - Parth Bansal: What do you think about two 20 year olds
11/05/2025, 22:50 - Om Paglu: That's worse
11/05/2025, 22:50 - Om Paglu: That's the time for super development of character
11/05/2025, 22:50 - Om Paglu: Om knew all these since his childhood...why don't u😅
11/05/2025, 22:51 - Parth Bansal: If I'm asking a question that doesn't mean I don't know the answer nigs it just I want your opinion
11/05/2025, 22:51 - Om Paglu: Ha ha I know that 🤣🤣
11/05/2025, 22:51 - Parth Bansal: + they are subjective you don't have a right or a wrong answer
11/05/2025, 22:52 - Om Paglu: Yeah true 100%
11/05/2025, 22:52 - Parth Bansal: I can give you a situation in which its good 
100%
11/05/2025, 22:52 - Om Paglu: Hmm,that is?
11/05/2025, 22:53 - Parth Bansal: See a both of them love staying in touch with each other they both love a similar topic like in your case that's aero and both of them help each other while being in a relationship
11/05/2025, 22:53 - Parth Bansal: How's that bad I don't see a single reason for which it could be bad
11/05/2025, 22:53 - Om Paglu: See i know what u mean
11/05/2025, 22:54 - Om Paglu: But it's very rare
11/05/2025, 22:54 - Om Paglu: And I don't feel taking a risk is worth it
11/05/2025, 22:54 - Om Paglu: Maybe bcoz of my past trauma 😭
11/05/2025, 22:54 - Parth Bansal: Why can't you be in a relationship and develop you character is another question
11/05/2025, 22:55 - Om Paglu: Bcoz i feel relationship consumes time,and it's a bit of sacrifice
11/05/2025, 22:55 - Parth Bansal: You are not productive 100% of the time
11/05/2025, 22:55 - Om Paglu: +in kaliyug it's impossible to find someone like this
11/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: Most important point
11/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: Ppl usually have some side intentions😭
11/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: Unlike Om
11/05/2025, 22:56 - Parth Bansal: That's true
11/05/2025, 22:57 - Om Paglu: Then I uld Sleep most of the time😭
11/05/2025, 22:57 - Parth Bansal: + like driven people Passionate about aero that's a side hustle
11/05/2025, 22:57 - Om Paglu: Atleast no sacrifice
11/05/2025, 22:58 - Om Paglu: In kaliyuga, it's impossible to find someone like that
11/05/2025, 22:58 - Om Paglu: Also say ppl have pure intentions,but then u succeed a lot
11/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: Then ur partner will pull u down a lot
11/05/2025, 22:59 - Parth Bansal: That's crazy to think like that because what's crazy is now you have some one to sleep with so they can even sleep better and healthy sleep
11/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: That's what ppl do in kaliyuga
11/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: Unlike Om
11/05/2025, 22:59 - Parth Bansal: No man u are judging based on one experience
11/05/2025, 23:00 - Parth Bansal: No one likes to pull some one down
11/05/2025, 23:00 - Parth Bansal: At least gud people
11/05/2025, 23:00 - Om Paglu: Obviously not.I uld hate to have someone Sleep with
11/05/2025, 23:00 - Parth Bansal: They like to help <This message was edited>
11/05/2025, 23:00 - Om Paglu: Just like I said, it's difficult to find someone like that.Everyone isn't like u
11/05/2025, 23:01 - Parth Bansal: See it's unique to 
I can say with most certainity that 99.9% of people will have a better sleep if they have a partner <This message was edited>
11/05/2025, 23:02 - Om Paglu: Except Om
11/05/2025, 23:02 - Om Paglu: And me
11/05/2025, 23:03 - Om Paglu: And hen
11/05/2025, 23:03 - Parth Bansal: It reduces loneliness and stress
11/05/2025, 23:03 - Parth Bansal: Why is hen here?
11/05/2025, 23:03 - Om Paglu: There r other ways too

11/05/2025, 23:03 - Om Paglu: He's also like this
11/05/2025, 23:03 - Parth Bansal: No better way than a sound sleep
11/05/2025, 23:04 - Om Paglu: Why to have a sound sleep
11/05/2025, 23:04 - Parth Bansal: I would say he would also love to sleep with someone not alone <This message was edited>

11/05/2025, 23:04 - Om Paglu: All for humanity
11/05/2025, 23:04 - Om Paglu: All for these ppl who have a sound sleep
11/05/2025, 23:05 - Parth Bansal: Ur just mad nigs development is not a single day thing it takes yrs to develop something gud you can sacrifice some nights but when ur the most tensed and when you wanna sleep that's the time when stress and loneliness kicks in then you want someone it's like that
11/05/2025, 23:06 - Parth Bansal: Lmao ded
11/05/2025, 23:06 - Parth Bansal: So you wanna develop something good for lazy pieces of shit
11/05/2025, 23:07 - Om Paglu: No bro u don't understand what I m trying to say
11/05/2025, 23:07 - Om Paglu: When u r super stressed u can just hang out with like minded ppl like Om
11/05/2025, 23:08 - Om Paglu: I uld prefer spending time with ppl like that in lab than staying in my house with a partner
11/05/2025, 23:08 - Parth Bansal: Naa i don't think when you are stressed you want technical people around you
I would prefer someone who doesnot know Abt my field but like can take care of people
11/05/2025, 23:09 - Om Paglu: See again it's personal
11/05/2025, 23:09 - Om Paglu: But I uld like to spend time speaking something else to tech ppl only
11/05/2025, 23:09 - Om Paglu: Like something completely different

11/05/2025, 23:10 - Om Paglu: Something other than aero
11/05/2025, 23:11 - Om Paglu: But I uld like to speak to him other than other ppl
11/05/2025, 23:11 - Parth Bansal: Thats exactly what I said non tech stuff hanging out with people who know how to take care of other ppl
11/05/2025, 23:12 - Om Paglu: But other ppl knew how to take care as well

11/05/2025, 23:14 - Parth Bansal: I can't rlly say anything now
11/05/2025, 23:14 - Om Paglu: Why bro?
11/05/2025, 23:15 - Parth Bansal: Like I have ran out of logical arguments
11/05/2025, 23:15 - Om Paglu: Isn't it the normal logic?
11/05/2025, 23:15 - Parth Bansal: Now I don't know how it can be different I will think about it before going to bed
11/05/2025, 23:16 - Om Paglu: Maybe everyone is different

11/05/2025, 23:19 - Parth Bansal: Hmm Two most likely unique ones

11/05/2025, 23:20 - Om Paglu: Bcoz no one is like me other than Om🤣
11/05/2025, 23:20 - Parth Bansal: And you are looking for people like you
11/05/2025, 23:20 - Parth Bansal: Not a lot of people look for people like themselves

11/05/2025, 23:21 - Om Paglu: Why will i
11/05/2025, 23:22 - Parth Bansal: Ohh
11/05/2025, 23:23 - Parth Bansal: That's a lot of personality discussion

12/05/2025, 00:14 - Om Paglu: She's so cute
12/05/2025, 00:14 - Om Paglu: How i wish she existed till now
12/05/2025, 00:15 - Om Paglu: Why did she go away so early 😭😭
12/05/2025, 00:15 - Parth Bansal: Bro ur so different
babies are meant to be adults
12/05/2025, 00:15 - Om Paglu: But I want to hold her once
12/05/2025, 00:15 - Parth Bansal: Do you think that was your prime
12/05/2025, 00:15 - Om Paglu: And tell her how much I love her
12/05/2025, 00:16 - Parth Bansal: Yea and for that you have to become a mother or maybe hold someone else's baby but then that someone else has to be a mother
12/05/2025, 00:16 - Om Paglu: So that the depression phase never came
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Parth Bansal: .
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Om Paglu: Better option -go to an orphanage and hold someone and come back
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Parth Bansal: Yea
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Parth Bansal: I told that option too
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Om Paglu: That was the time I uld like to go back too😭😭
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Parth Bansal: Prime time
12/05/2025, 00:17 - Om Paglu: Hmm
12/05/2025, 00:18 - Om Paglu: But then that child won't look the same,right
12/05/2025, 00:19 - Parth Bansal: That's why I was saying being a parent is the best feeling in the world
12/05/2025, 00:19 - Om Paglu: Obviously not for me
12/05/2025, 00:19 - Parth Bansal: See now u have contradictory opinions
12/05/2025, 00:19 - Om Paglu: That will make things worse for everyone
12/05/2025, 00:20 - Om Paglu: Bcoz ppl will b reminded of their own lost past
12/05/2025, 00:20 - Parth Bansal: What
12/05/2025, 00:20 - Om Paglu: Which they can't go back to, even if they sacrifice everything
12/05/2025, 00:21 - Om Paglu: So they r left with only 2 options.Either killing themselves or killing the child
12/05/2025, 00:21 - Parth Bansal: So u wanna re live your past?
12/05/2025, 00:21 - Parth Bansal: Hold on what I didn't get how we came here
12/05/2025, 00:21 - Om Paglu: Bro,why do u always think in the opposite way🤣
12/05/2025, 00:21 - Om Paglu: ?
12/05/2025, 00:21 - Parth Bansal: Nahh man it's the most normal and conventional way
12/05/2025, 00:22 - Om Paglu: Idk...then maybe I m unique in all ways🤣
12/05/2025, 00:22 - Parth Bansal: Why are there these two options i didn't get your logic
12/05/2025, 00:22 - Om Paglu: Just like hen
12/05/2025, 00:23 - Parth Bansal: Hen how did he come into picture
12/05/2025, 00:23 - Om Paglu: Bcoz their own lost past will continuously hurt them
12/05/2025, 00:23 - Om Paglu: Hen also thinks like me🤣
12/05/2025, 00:24 - Parth Bansal: How do you know?
12/05/2025, 00:24 - Om Paglu: Isn't it obvious
12/05/2025, 00:24 - Om Paglu: I mean how can anyone think differently
12/05/2025, 00:24 - Om Paglu: Idk...jk🤣
12/05/2025, 00:25 - Om Paglu: See actually I like the name hen...I mean vihaan ->hen🤣
12/05/2025, 00:25 - Parth Bansal: See just asking so what u think is a person wants to relive their past and can't do there are two options
12/05/2025, 00:25 - Om Paglu: Not really
12/05/2025, 00:25 - Om Paglu: Other options r there too
12/05/2025, 00:25 - Parth Bansal: Then what were u saying
12/05/2025, 00:26 - Om Paglu: Detaching from family life,like spending entire time in work and career
12/05/2025, 00:26 - Om Paglu: Or becoming a sanyasi (like iit baba🤣)
12/05/2025, 00:26 - Parth Bansal: One of the worst options

16/05/2025, 09:43 - Om Paglu: Unlike other departments
16/05/2025, 09:44 - Om Paglu: That's why few subdivisions r seperated from the min building
16/05/2025, 09:45 - Parth Bansal: bro i just it looks old i say the chem building also looks old in IITB that doesn't mean the department itself is bad
16/05/2025, 09:45 - Om Paglu: Yeah it is

16/05/2025, 09:52 - Parth Bansal: why
16/05/2025, 09:52 - Om Paglu: Bcoz iitm culture is suitable for us
16/05/2025, 09:52 - Parth Bansal: because like you are too passionate and there not so many people deeply interested in Aero
16/05/2025, 09:52 - Om Paglu: In iitb
16/05/2025, 09:52 - Parth Bansal: hmm thats what i meant

16/05/2025, 09:53 - Parth Bansal: what other things are different there
16/05/2025, 09:53 - Om Paglu: It's difficult to explain
16/05/2025, 09:54 - Om Paglu: Like even if u r not passionate in aero,u'll feel a sense of pride if u r in aero

16/05/2025, 14:33 - Parth Bansal: Nahh ain't no one is better than him
16/05/2025, 14:33 - Om Paglu: It's the same na...if u had taken up an intern

16/05/2025, 14:34 - Om Paglu: And submit a report at the end
16/05/2025, 14:34 - Om Paglu: Only difference...u would have gotten a lor
16/05/2025, 14:34 - Om Paglu: U could have stayed at someone else's home...
16/05/2025, 14:34 - Parth Bansal: But why would anyone accept me as an intern
16/05/2025, 14:34 - Parth Bansal: I don't like that
16/05/2025, 14:35 - Om Paglu: Just for the same reason they accepted me
16/05/2025, 14:35 - Parth Bansal: But like you have passion i don't have nothing
16/05/2025, 14:35 - Om Paglu: Neither do i...but this person's home is special

16/05/2025, 14:56 - Om Paglu: Yeah that's fine
16/05/2025, 14:57 - Om Paglu: Ohh wait,I know why I felt so
16/05/2025, 14:57 - Om Paglu: Maybe bcoz of depression
16/05/2025, 14:57 - Parth Bansal: Maybe I have been told this many many times

17/05/2025, 20:20 - Om Paglu: I follow 2-3 books+utube lecture
17/05/2025, 20:20 - Om Paglu: For simulation,I use a software
17/05/2025, 20:20 - Parth Bansal: Hell nahh making your report is borderline nightmare
17/05/2025, 20:21 - Om Paglu: Kyu??
17/05/2025, 20:21 - Om Paglu: That's what an intern is supposed to make
17/05/2025, 20:21 - Parth Bansal: Because it's hectic
17/05/2025, 20:21 - Om Paglu: Prof expects u to research on ur own
17/05/2025, 20:21 - Parth Bansal: Do you have structured  topics?
17/05/2025, 20:21 - Om Paglu: On the basis of this and enthu, they'll give u a lor
17/05/2025, 20:22 - Om Paglu: Nah...r u crazy🤣
17/05/2025, 20:22 - Parth Bansal: Then what the hell
17/05/2025, 20:22 - Om Paglu: See for example
17/05/2025, 20:23 - Om Paglu: Prof said to learn about rankine and gas cycles
17/05/2025, 20:23 - Om Paglu: At simulate them for different conditions and submit a report at the end
17/05/2025, 20:23 - Om Paglu: So now it's up to me
17/05/2025, 20:23 - Parth Bansal: Ohh so first you need to decide topics
17/05/2025, 20:23 - Om Paglu: Though he assigned a PhD guide
17/05/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: To help me
17/05/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: And assist me with everything
17/05/2025, 20:24 - Parth Bansal: Your intern is a nightmare sort of a thing
17/05/2025, 20:24 - Parth Bansal: So how does this person help yo
17/05/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: That's what a research intern is supposed to be

17/05/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: Like schedule
17/05/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: Topic wise
17/05/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: And help me understand things if I have any doubt
17/05/2025, 20:25 - Parth Bansal: So you have topics and books
17/05/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: But at the end I need to search for sources
17/05/2025, 20:25 - Parth Bansal: Now
17/05/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: Like a proper research work
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: Like after going though a book that he recommended,I felt it wasn't that much of a detail
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Parth Bansal: Won't he tell you that also
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: So I had to search other books
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: +YouTube channels
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Parth Bansal: YouTube is best
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Parth Bansal: For me
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: Then what's the point of research 🥲
17/05/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: Though he helped me learn the entire simulation software
17/05/2025, 20:27 - Parth Bansal: Don't research just look it up ask chat gpt everything
17/05/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: Sometimes it might b wrong+prof wants very very detailed information
17/05/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: At the end prof wants a crystal clear understanding
17/05/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: *hope u know the research culture in iitm

17/05/2025, 20:31 - Parth Bansal: Being renowned and being available are not mutually exclusive
17/05/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: If u want an internship,u need to b very genius

17/05/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: The culture here is completely different
17/05/2025, 20:35 - Parth Bansal: IITM or iitb
17/05/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: Iitm
17/05/2025, 20:36 - Om Paglu: I meant many ppl took aero bcoz they didn't get anything better
17/05/2025, 20:36 - Om Paglu: But now most ppl regret not taking aero and taking better things

17/05/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: Well a little
17/05/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: But aero is like luck
17/05/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: Bro are u saying the is 0 chance of me getting intern in mech
17/05/2025, 20:38 - Om Paglu: Not really

17/05/2025, 20:39 - Parth Bansal: I would prolly not do any intern in mech
17/05/2025, 20:39 - Parth Bansal: It will prolly be in ML
17/05/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: Then aero?
17/05/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: Ohh...then maybe u might get accepted in iitm
17/05/2025, 20:40 - Parth Bansal: Why would I go iitm
17/05/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: Then where?
17/05/2025, 20:40 - Parth Bansal: There are better places for ML
17/05/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: Bcoz it's the best in aero
17/05/2025, 20:40 - Parth Bansal: I would not do a research intern

17/05/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: See actually in bengali tu is used for a close friend
17/05/2025, 20:44 - Parth Bansal: Don't try to think of reasons
17/05/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: Tum is for a senior (who is not a friend)
17/05/2025, 20:45 - Parth Bansal: Whatt tu is disrespectful like you can not say tu to older ppl
17/05/2025, 20:45 - Om Paglu: And aap is for a stranger
17/05/2025, 20:45 - Parth Bansal: Not disrespectful

17/05/2025, 21:16 - Parth Bansal: How often do you talk to him
17/05/2025, 21:16 - Om Paglu: This question was :who m I missing rn?
17/05/2025, 21:16 - Om Paglu: Sometimes

17/05/2025, 21:18 - Om Paglu: But again
17/05/2025, 21:18 - Om Paglu: For clearing any doubts...I don't have a crush on him
17/05/2025, 21:18 - Parth Bansal: Ok you don't have to assert that every time we bring him
17/05/2025, 21:18 - Parth Bansal: It s ok
17/05/2025, 21:19 - Parth Bansal: I just say it for jokes
17/05/2025, 21:19 - Om Paglu: But most ppl think in that way
17/05/2025, 21:19 - Parth Bansal: Yes it's natural, but there is a difference between someone you look up to and someone you have a crush on
17/05/2025, 21:19 - Parth Bansal: That's definitely ok
17/05/2025, 21:24 - Om Paglu: I look up to Alyssa Carson
17/05/2025, 21:24 - Om Paglu: She's my role model
17/05/2025, 21:25 - Parth Bansal: Yea nice
17/05/2025, 21:25 - Om Paglu: See actually I feel
17/05/2025, 21:25 - Om Paglu: We shouldn't have crush in college... it'll just pull u down
17/05/2025, 21:26 - Parth Bansal: See do you want a living example of this statement being false
17/05/2025, 21:26 - Om Paglu: We should fight our hormones
17/05/2025, 21:26 - Om Paglu: Yeah
17/05/2025, 21:26 - Parth Bansal: Shreya and Karan
17/05/2025, 21:26 - Om Paglu: Lol what an example is this... being a topper in college doesn't mean success in actual life
17/05/2025, 21:27 - Om Paglu: Actual success demands lots of other things as well
17/05/2025, 21:27 - Parth Bansal: Nahh she actually does everything
17/05/2025, 21:27 - Om Paglu: It doesn't mean she's going to b successful in life
17/05/2025, 21:27 - Parth Bansal: That's true I'm a brand ambassador of this statement
17/05/2025, 21:27 - Om Paglu: It doesn't mean ppl r going to remember her after her death
17/05/2025, 21:27 - Parth Bansal: Ohh you mean this kind of success
17/05/2025, 21:28 - Om Paglu: It doesn't mean she's going to change the world
17/05/2025, 21:28 - Parth Bansal: I thought financial success
17/05/2025, 21:28 - Om Paglu: See we r born for some particular purpose
17/05/2025, 21:28 - Om Paglu: Obviously to contribute to the world someway or the other
17/05/2025, 21:29 - Om Paglu: So success is when our contribution is completed
17/05/2025, 21:29 - Parth Bansal: You never know what contribution you were supposed to make so you are never successful
17/05/2025, 21:29 - Om Paglu: For example: Alyssa's contribution is making the world know about Mars.For that she's even ready to sacrifice her life.
17/05/2025, 21:30 - Om Paglu: Bro come on... I meant go on as long as u r not satisfied with urself <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 21:30 - Om Paglu: As long as ppl respect u for ur contributions
17/05/2025, 21:31 - Om Paglu: Also,how could u come up with this example... prolly,not an example at all🤣
17/05/2025, 21:32 - Parth Bansal: See your definition of success is a very long term type definition
17/05/2025, 21:32 - Om Paglu: Obviously... that's what success is supposed to be,u can ask Om too
17/05/2025, 21:32 - Parth Bansal: See i don't think there relation has affected them in any way that's why I said it was not to prove that anyone will be successful in their life
17/05/2025, 21:33 - Om Paglu: Bro,how can u b so dumb
17/05/2025, 21:33 - Om Paglu: Listen
17/05/2025, 21:33 - Om Paglu: I meant
17/05/2025, 21:33 - Parth Bansal: Bro nahh you have to think who is Om to tell what success is truly subjective
17/05/2025, 21:33 - Om Paglu: If u r in a relationship, u'll feel like something is pulling down,then some insecurities also exist
17/05/2025, 21:34 - Parth Bansal: Success is a very subjective topic I think living a happy life having enough money so that you don't worry Abt money is a successful life
17/05/2025, 21:34 - Om Paglu: What's the point in all these when u already know real success takes a long time...so what's the point of taking risk
17/05/2025, 21:34 - Om Paglu: Listen I m telling u something
17/05/2025, 21:34 - Om Paglu: In my dad's college
17/05/2025, 21:35 - Om Paglu: There was a girl who used to b the topper
17/05/2025, 21:35 - Om Paglu: Then she married someone of the same batch(he was also some kind of a dr)
17/05/2025, 21:35 - Om Paglu: Now they both settled in UK
17/05/2025, 21:35 - Om Paglu: But,still she always regrets her past
17/05/2025, 21:36 - Om Paglu: Some bondage took place which acted detrimental to her dreams
17/05/2025, 21:36 - Om Paglu: She has a lot of money now and a happy family
17/05/2025, 21:37 - Om Paglu: But she lost what she actually wanted
17/05/2025, 21:37 - Om Paglu: She has that...but is she successful?if u ask her,she says that she uld b happy if she could reverse time
17/05/2025, 21:38 - Parth Bansal: Are u sure u u wanted to say bondage?
17/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: And I also feel success is something else...
17/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: Yup, marriage is a great bondage, don't u know or what
17/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: Setting a certain time for ur family
17/05/2025, 21:38 - Parth Bansal: Bondage means being a slave ??
17/05/2025, 21:39 - Om Paglu: According to me
17/05/2025, 21:39 - Om Paglu: Bondage is when u have to spend certain time for someone else
17/05/2025, 21:39 - Parth Bansal: What did she want?
17/05/2025, 21:39 - Parth Bansal: Ohh
17/05/2025, 21:39 - Om Paglu: She wanted to b a world famous doctor
17/05/2025, 21:40 - Parth Bansal: What is she?
17/05/2025, 21:40 - Parth Bansal: Now
17/05/2025, 21:40 - Om Paglu: She wanted to create a change in the medical field
17/05/2025, 21:40 - Om Paglu: She is a doctor obviously...but she didn't get time to research
17/05/2025, 21:40 - Om Paglu: And to contribute something to the world
17/05/2025, 21:41 - Parth Bansal: How do you know that her marriage is what stopped her?
17/05/2025, 21:41 - Om Paglu: She said
17/05/2025, 21:41 - Om Paglu: How else will I know 🤣
17/05/2025, 21:41 - Parth Bansal: Wow
17/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: Like in initial stages say in college life and all
17/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: She had high dreams
17/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: Like I'll research once I go to Europe
17/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: Then she went too
17/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: Then she married
17/05/2025, 21:43 - Om Paglu: In relationship and marriage,she didn't feel like going out of her comfort zone
17/05/2025, 21:43 - Om Paglu: That happens to everyone actually
17/05/2025, 21:44 - Om Paglu: U can ask Om too
17/05/2025, 21:44 - Parth Bansal: I don't know man some ppl rlly think differently i don't wanna create a huge change i just want to live happily like a simple happy life
17/05/2025, 21:44 - Om Paglu: Then what r u giving back to the society?
17/05/2025, 21:45 - Parth Bansal: If i earn enough then I will make schools in my hometown
17/05/2025, 21:45 - Om Paglu: Should I ask Om?
17/05/2025, 21:45 - Parth Bansal: And make sure everyone gets real education
17/05/2025, 21:45 - Parth Bansal: No
17/05/2025, 21:45 - Om Paglu: Ok, fine...but how r u using ur iq in this way?

17/05/2025, 21:47 - Om Paglu: Won't u feel that u did something really useful for the humanity
17/05/2025, 21:47 - Parth Bansal: It depends ur definition of satisfaction is different
17/05/2025, 21:47 - Om Paglu: Ok
17/05/2025, 21:47 - Parth Bansal: .

17/05/2025, 21:48 - Parth Bansal: How many ppl are thankful to mk Gandhi
17/05/2025, 21:48 - Om Paglu: No one
17/05/2025, 21:49 - Om Paglu: Ppl who analyze history properly can realize how shrewd he was
17/05/2025, 21:49 - Om Paglu: Not really a good person
17/05/2025, 21:49 - Parth Bansal: How many generations after us will remember mk Gandhi?
17/05/2025, 21:49 - Parth Bansal: Why not bro did everything he could

17/05/2025, 21:50 - Om Paglu: Will discuss some other day
17/05/2025, 21:50 - Parth Bansal: The answer is most prolly at max 2 generations
17/05/2025, 21:50 - Om Paglu: That's bcoz he was a bd person
17/05/2025, 21:50 - Om Paglu: But say Einstein
17/05/2025, 21:50 - Om Paglu: As long as the world lives
17/05/2025, 21:51 - Om Paglu: Or Newton <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 21:51 - Parth Bansal: How many ppl are thankful to einstein for his discovery in India?
17/05/2025, 21:51 - Om Paglu: Everyone
17/05/2025, 21:51 - Om Paglu: Except illiterates
17/05/2025, 21:52 - Parth Bansal: Nahh nobody gives a shit everybody thinks E = mc^2 and that too they misinterpret mc
17/05/2025, 21:52 - Om Paglu: They r illiterates right
17/05/2025, 21:52 - Om Paglu: Why should u think about them in the first place
17/05/2025, 21:52 - Parth Bansal: So anyone who has studied till 12 th and not done clg is illiterate
17/05/2025, 21:52 - Om Paglu: Yup
17/05/2025, 21:52 - Om Paglu: Till 10th
17/05/2025, 21:53 - Parth Bansal: So you think ppl of our and one generation older who have done till 12 th know einstein's contribution?
17/05/2025, 21:54 - Parth Bansal: I don't think ncert tells einstein's contribution
17/05/2025, 21:54 - Parth Bansal: Real contribution
17/05/2025, 21:54 - Om Paglu: Most ppl do
17/05/2025, 21:54 - Om Paglu: I think it was there
17/05/2025, 21:54 - Om Paglu: Bcoz I studied in class 11th
17/05/2025, 21:54 - Parth Bansal: Try thinking from general perspective
17/05/2025, 21:55 - Parth Bansal: Not from your perspective
17/05/2025, 21:55 - Om Paglu: Yeah I m a general person only... average in world level
17/05/2025, 21:55 - Parth Bansal: Only 27% go to clg after 12 th so in India 73% are illiterates
17/05/2025, 21:55 - Om Paglu: Yeah, obviously
17/05/2025, 21:55 - Parth Bansal: And they would never know about Einstein's contribution
17/05/2025, 21:56 - Parth Bansal: Bro btw what's the definition of literacy?
17/05/2025, 21:56 - Om Paglu: Why should u think about them in the first place...no need to think about illiterates
17/05/2025, 21:56 - Om Paglu: According to me,literacy means when u have sufficient knowledge to distinguish good from the bad and act accordingly
17/05/2025, 21:57 - Om Paglu: Not follow the common mass
17/05/2025, 21:58 - Parth Bansal: So after passing 12th you didn't know what was good and what was bad?
17/05/2025, 21:58 - Parth Bansal: In general terms of good and bad
17/05/2025, 21:58 - Parth Bansal: Like stealing things is bad type bad
17/05/2025, 21:58 - Om Paglu: Lemme ask u a question
17/05/2025, 21:58 - Om Paglu: Not that bro🤣🤣
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Om Paglu: What is nirvana?
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Parth Bansal: Ik
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Om Paglu: And why is it important?
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Om Paglu: Explain
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Parth Bansal: It's not important and there is no prove of nirvana
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Om Paglu: Ok fine
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Parth Bansal: It's when you are liberated
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Om Paglu: Then let me ask u
17/05/2025, 21:59 - Parth Bansal: Ask
17/05/2025, 22:00 - Om Paglu: Suppose u r given 2 options
17/05/2025, 22:00 - Om Paglu: 1)lead a happy life full of friends,money, lots of free time
17/05/2025, 22:01 - Om Paglu: 2)work continuously for developing a medicine for Alzheimer's.in this case very less money,no free time, Sleeping in lab,no family at all
17/05/2025, 22:01 - Om Paglu: Which one will u choose
17/05/2025, 22:01 - Parth Bansal: Wait for life time
17/05/2025, 22:01 - Om Paglu: Yup
17/05/2025, 22:02 - Parth Bansal: Lemme think
17/05/2025, 22:02 - Parth Bansal: It's not a easy question
17/05/2025, 22:02 - Om Paglu: Yeah,take ur time
17/05/2025, 22:02 - Om Paglu: Why didn't u think earlier though
17/05/2025, 22:02 - Om Paglu: U r already 18
...u should have already thought of all these
17/05/2025, 22:03 - Parth Bansal: See it's really live well or die fulfilled (that is only if you do something and guarantee of which is very less)
17/05/2025, 22:03 - Om Paglu: Yeah
17/05/2025, 22:03 - Om Paglu: Ur answer?
17/05/2025, 22:04 - Parth Bansal: If i think I can do SMTH for alzheimer's if i have a clear Parth then b
Otherwise a
17/05/2025, 22:04 - Om Paglu: Parth🤣🤣
17/05/2025, 22:04 - Om Paglu: See suppose at this stage
17/05/2025, 22:04 - Parth Bansal: A
17/05/2025, 22:04 - Parth Bansal: Because
17/05/2025, 22:05 - Parth Bansal: I don't wanna work in any field in exploring stuff
17/05/2025, 22:05 - Parth Bansal: Is what I'm doing
17/05/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: Why not?
17/05/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: U know u have the iq
17/05/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: So why not put in hardwork
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Parth Bansal: In which field?
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Om Paglu: In something the world needs asap
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Om Paglu: Say Alzheimer's
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Parth Bansal: I don't think I can help
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Parth Bansal: Wait
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Om Paglu: Why not?even if u can't,why not try <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 22:06 - Parth Bansal: Let's think about this probabilistically
17/05/2025, 22:07 - Om Paglu: Even if the probability is 0.000001
17/05/2025, 22:07 - Om Paglu: Still...
17/05/2025, 22:07 - Om Paglu: Why not try?
17/05/2025, 22:07 - Om Paglu: Atleast I uld have chosen path B in all cases
17/05/2025, 22:07 - Om Paglu: And forced Om to do the same🤣
17/05/2025, 22:08 - Om Paglu: Wait...lemme ask him once
17/05/2025, 22:08 - Parth Bansal: The chances of me making a huge change are exponentially low
So that means i die exhausted + didn't do anything for anyone
Why not go for something that I have a higher probability of success in
And help locals in my home town so atleast some ppl will be happy and some one from then will also do something for others
17/05/2025, 22:09 - Parth Bansal: Max plank studied his ass off who knows him
17/05/2025, 22:09 - Parth Bansal: Nobody gives him credit
17/05/2025, 22:11 - Parth Bansal: I just chose a realistic path of contribution
17/05/2025, 22:12 - Parth Bansal: If more ppl served the community the world would be a better place and alzheimer's would have been cured earlier
17/05/2025, 22:12 - Om Paglu: Fine... it's ur decision,but think about it twice
17/05/2025, 22:13 - Om Paglu: Ppl in quantum world obviously
17/05/2025, 22:13 - Parth Bansal: Meaningful, balanced impact vs extreme gamble
17/05/2025, 22:13 - Parth Bansal: How many are they not even handful
17/05/2025, 22:13 - Om Paglu: I do
17/05/2025, 22:13 - Om Paglu: In fact bcoz of planck the world is about to change
17/05/2025, 22:14 - Om Paglu: So he should b respected
17/05/2025, 22:14 - Parth Bansal: He*should* be respected <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 22:14 - Om Paglu: Can u imagine,such a difficult branch of physics...how could he even come up with the ideas
17/05/2025, 22:14 - Om Paglu: More than Einstein I mean
17/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: And Om too
17/05/2025, 22:16 - Parth Bansal: It doesn't matter who cares anyways he didn't know that what he found could actually be useful he just died hoping SMTH is going to come out of it many die hoping only
17/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: So what...this hope is what u should have
17/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: It's better than living an easy life
17/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: Om also has high hopes
17/05/2025, 22:16 - Parth Bansal: . What do u think
17/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: Served what community?
17/05/2025, 22:17 - Parth Bansal: I don't like gambling
17/05/2025, 22:17 - Parth Bansal: Yes like hometowns and stuff only
17/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: Alzheimer's is something else
17/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: It's a genetical disease
17/05/2025, 22:18 - Om Paglu: So proper treatment is obviously needed
17/05/2025, 22:18 - Om Paglu: Researches r going on
17/05/2025, 22:18 - Om Paglu: But all is unsuccessful
17/05/2025, 22:18 - Om Paglu: 😭😭
17/05/2025, 22:19 - Parth Bansal: 99.99% would think dying in hope is worse than dying living a peaceful meaningful, socially impactful life
17/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: Not Om and I
17/05/2025, 22:19 - Parth Bansal: Yea it's a gamble and you are willing to gamble
17/05/2025, 22:20 - Om Paglu: Like Om
17/05/2025, 22:20 - Om Paglu: *though Om wants to set up a company
17/05/2025, 22:20 - Parth Bansal: I respect everyone i won't call 12th pass ppl illiterate
17/05/2025, 22:20 - Parth Bansal: U know kailash satyarthi
17/05/2025, 22:21 - Om Paglu: No
17/05/2025, 22:21 - Om Paglu: om's relative?
17/05/2025, 22:21 - Om Paglu: Fine
17/05/2025, 22:21 - Parth Bansal: That's fking easy life according to you a company can never change the world and have a positive impact on the world one should not even hope that
17/05/2025, 22:22 - Om Paglu: Nope... not in aero
17/05/2025, 22:22 - Om Paglu: Don't u know the current scenario in aero industry?
17/05/2025, 22:22 - Parth Bansal: Company only runs if you have some money
17/05/2025, 22:22 - Parth Bansal: What do you think?
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Parth Bansal: To get money you would need investment
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Ik.That's why I tell him to research
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: If he doesn't research I'll kill him😡
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Parth Bansal: No investors would be interested in extreme gambling
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: ?
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: But Om is
17/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Bro...
17/05/2025, 22:24 - Om Paglu: Om wants to study hard from US and change aero industry in india
17/05/2025, 22:24 - Om Paglu: And that'll take a long time,since aero in India is underdeveloped
17/05/2025, 22:24 - Parth Bansal: He didn't do clg he helped over 85K ppl from the web if child labor nobel prize awardee 2014
So think before you speak u can call him illiterate if you want i would call him a hero
17/05/2025, 22:24 - Om Paglu: Ur relative?
17/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: That's different...he contributed nothing according to his iq
17/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: He was an activist
17/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: That's completely different in research line
17/05/2025, 22:25 - Parth Bansal: But acc to you he is illiterate
17/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: Hmm
17/05/2025, 22:26 - Parth Bansal: Dhirubai Ambani
17/05/2025, 22:26 - Parth Bansal: You know him right?
17/05/2025, 22:26 - Parth Bansal: His impact

17/05/2025, 22:27 - Om Paglu: For me good ppl r Om and his type of ppl🤣
17/05/2025, 22:28 - Parth Bansal: Because of him only you are able to text jio revolutionized the industry. Because of him many ppl are able to eat 
He is a very bad person 
What is a good person that does fking nothing nn the world and dies hoping he mere contributions will help
17/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Yup
17/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Good ppl r who research
17/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: And change the world
17/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Like Kadambari
17/05/2025, 22:29 - Parth Bansal: I don't know why you can't admire other ppl
17/05/2025, 22:29 - Parth Bansal: I would say those ppl are pathetic
17/05/2025, 22:29 - Om Paglu: https://youtube.com/shorts/DAMakY9Rgyo?si=BNe4dkw3qNutvLLB
17/05/2025, 22:30 - Om Paglu: Obviously I do...some selected ppl
17/05/2025, 22:30 - Parth Bansal: Imagine not respecting kailash satyarthi and dhirubhai Ambani
17/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: I respect Kailash satyarthi
17/05/2025, 22:31 - Parth Bansal: I can't understand
17/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: I respect all nationalists
17/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: In fact my mom is also involved
17/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: Did u hear it?
17/05/2025, 22:31 - Parth Bansal: Yes but it's too fast
17/05/2025, 22:33 - Om Paglu: Ohh i see
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: Cutting ties with family and friends removes emotional safety net, without periodic recharge in long term mental health would suffer
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: And chances would get more astronomical
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: I don't think so
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: U can have a cat
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Or family members
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Matlab parents
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: Didn't you say no family
17/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Not marriage
17/05/2025, 22:36 - Om Paglu: Haan... just talking over call to parents
17/05/2025, 22:36 - Om Paglu: Who live far away
17/05/2025, 22:36 - Parth Bansal: They will also perish some day
17/05/2025, 22:39 - Parth Bansal: An “all-in” approach leaves no room for backup plans. If your research hits an roadblock (funding cuts, experimental failures), you’re left with nothing to fall back on.
17/05/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: Cat is there na
17/05/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: Everything except marriage is ok
17/05/2025, 22:40 - Parth Bansal: See you rlly have that fire inside you and you can't see it from outer person's perspective
17/05/2025, 22:41 - Parth Bansal: When you can truly analyze your situation then it's okay to research but I don't think you are able to
17/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: Analyze situation?
17/05/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: Wdym?
17/05/2025, 22:42 - Parth Bansal: Analyze your future life not aimlessly work like those dumb fellows
17/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: I have already analyzed properly
17/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: Just like hen
17/05/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: https://youtu.be/aJtFbvRFZwk?si=Oq54efsEynshmKmh
17/05/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: I think one owes something to themselves happiness and health .complete self neglect is a dubious sacrifice
17/05/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: Nahh I don't think so
17/05/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: And what about Om then?
17/05/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: .
17/05/2025, 22:47 - Om Paglu: Dance in this
17/05/2025, 22:47 - Parth Bansal: Nothing there is no plan you have fire within you and you can't see the circumstances is what I think 
I also had that same kind of fire in me during JEE i worked my ass of i studied 12 hrs a day for more than 2 years and this is not a joke 
What did I get fking nothing so what if the plan A is not successful in research when the funding stops you don't have aplan b because you don't have any skill
17/05/2025, 22:48 - Om Paglu: Bro u think I didn't anlyze all probabilities
17/05/2025, 22:48 - Om Paglu: I have other backup plans too
17/05/2025, 22:49 - Parth Bansal: What are those plans?
17/05/2025, 22:49 - Parth Bansal: If i may know
17/05/2025, 22:49 - Om Paglu: First of all if I have a PhD from a good university in america
17/05/2025, 22:49 - Om Paglu: They'll take me as a prof in American university
17/05/2025, 22:49 - Om Paglu: So money from there
17/05/2025, 22:49 - Om Paglu: And friend circle is colleagues
17/05/2025, 22:50 - Om Paglu: Other plan... joining some aero related companies there and research side by side
17/05/2025, 22:50 - Om Paglu: In case this fails
17/05/2025, 22:50 - Om Paglu: Or Europe
17/05/2025, 22:50 - Parth Bansal: So that's part of planA then 
Where is the plan B i don't know see
17/05/2025, 22:51 - Om Paglu: I don't need any other plan
17/05/2025, 22:51 - Om Paglu: Bcoz if not america
17/05/2025, 22:51 - Parth Bansal: And that's your planA is the first choice you gave me
17/05/2025, 22:51 - Om Paglu: Atleast I m not so dumb that no one in the world will select me
17/05/2025, 22:51 - Om Paglu: Atleast India is there
17/05/2025, 22:52 - Om Paglu: So obviously I'll get selected as a prof somewhere or the other
17/05/2025, 22:52 - Parth Bansal: Where is the part where you have no social circle no sleep only research no job
17/05/2025, 22:52 - Om Paglu: Bro...
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Om Paglu: When did I say no job??
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Om Paglu: Prof in america research a lot
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Om Paglu: There's nothing called only research and no job
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Parth Bansal: .your definition of plan A doesn't align with this is what I can say for sure
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Parth Bansal: Less money as an American prof
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Parth Bansal: Less free time?
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Parth Bansal: Sleeping in lab?
17/05/2025, 22:53 - Om Paglu: Yup
17/05/2025, 22:54 - Parth Bansal: Where are all ghese
17/05/2025, 22:54 - Om Paglu: Bcoz American lifestyle is super expensive
17/05/2025, 22:54 - Om Paglu: Less free time since u chose not to come back home and work continuously
17/05/2025, 22:54 - Om Paglu: No one is going to stop u
17/05/2025, 22:55 - Parth Bansal: So you want to work in America have no social life very less money(idk how as American profs are paid well prolly)
And sleep in labs
17/05/2025, 22:55 - Om Paglu: Know money there is high
17/05/2025, 22:55 - Om Paglu: But lifestyle is very expensive
17/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: Especially when u keep maids
17/05/2025, 22:56 - Parth Bansal: Yea that's true but a prof can afford that prolly
17/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: Yeah obviously
17/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: But I was considering the worst possible case
17/05/2025, 22:56 - Om Paglu: But how could u think no job🤣🤣
17/05/2025, 22:57 - Parth Bansal: So what's the problem money is out of the equation
17/05/2025, 22:57 - Om Paglu: Not really
17/05/2025, 22:57 - Parth Bansal: If money is out of the equation I would do research with no problem
17/05/2025, 22:57 - Om Paglu: Suppose if u want to buy an airplane?
17/05/2025, 22:58 - Parth Bansal: As an American prof 
Then you are stupid
17/05/2025, 22:58 - Om Paglu: I don't want to...I m saying,if u want to
17/05/2025, 22:58 - Parth Bansal: No i don't care what anyone says if an American prof doing research wants to buy private jet he is stupid
17/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: Yeah obviously 🤣
17/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: Just like Siowei
17/05/2025, 22:59 - Parth Bansal: I don't want to
17/05/2025, 22:59 - Parth Bansal: Why would I want to buy a airplane
17/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: What if ur gf wants?
17/05/2025, 22:59 - Om Paglu: Will u give her?
17/05/2025, 23:00 - Parth Bansal: I will ask why then she will have no solid reason then i will explain to her why this is a bad investment
17/05/2025, 23:00 - Parth Bansal: And then say no to her
17/05/2025, 23:00 - Om Paglu: What if she has a proper reason
17/05/2025, 23:00 - Om Paglu: And doesn't want to understand
17/05/2025, 23:01 - Parth Bansal: I would love to know the proper reason to have a private jet
17/05/2025, 23:01 - Om Paglu: If my bf asks, I'll teach him aerodynamics,and then we'll build it together 🤣
17/05/2025, 23:01 - Om Paglu: Ask her na
17/05/2025, 23:01 - Parth Bansal: Naa i would say no
17/05/2025, 23:01 - Om Paglu: And what if Om wants?
17/05/2025, 23:02 - Om Paglu: What branch uld u prefer ur gf to b ?
17/05/2025, 23:02 - Parth Bansal: Prolly she won't be my gf see i think I have certain iq cutoff and asking for private jet is negative iq so she prolly won't be my gf
17/05/2025, 23:02 - Om Paglu: Lol🤣🤣
17/05/2025, 23:02 - Parth Bansal: No preference
17/05/2025, 23:02 - Om Paglu: .

17/05/2025, 23:04 - Om Paglu: .
17/05/2025, 23:05 - Parth Bansal: This is a bit tricky for you too but past conversations suggest aeronautics <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 23:05 - Om Paglu: Nah

17/05/2025, 23:06 - Parth Bansal: So my actual answer is correct

17/05/2025, 23:07 - Parth Bansal: Older 1 yr
17/05/2025, 23:07 - Om Paglu: Why do u think so?
17/05/2025, 23:07 - Om Paglu: Bcoz of Om??
17/05/2025, 23:07 - Parth Bansal: Naahh
17/05/2025, 23:07 - Om Paglu: Then?
17/05/2025, 23:08 - Om Paglu: Anyways...the answer is,it doesn't matter
17/05/2025, 23:08 - Om Paglu: Though I uld prefer younger or same age
17/05/2025, 23:09 - Om Paglu: If older,max 1 year
17/05/2025, 23:09 - Parth Bansal: I just think so because of my crazyy calculations 
I vectorised out past chat using TFIDF then I asked AI to stemm and lemmentize the data the i processed those vectors and final and came out to be 1 yr older
17/05/2025, 23:09 - Om Paglu: Wtf!!🤣🤣
17/05/2025, 23:09 - Om Paglu: Maybe AI also thinks I have a crush on Om🤣
17/05/2025, 23:09 - Parth Bansal: Yeah Obv i have to use the things that i know to answer your questions
17/05/2025, 23:10 - Parth Bansal: Nahh au only did preprocessing
17/05/2025, 23:10 - Parth Bansal: I did rest of the stuff
17/05/2025, 23:10 - Parth Bansal: *Ai
17/05/2025, 23:10 - Om Paglu: Do u think all girls in college likes Om?
17/05/2025, 23:10 - Parth Bansal: Ain't nobody likes him because he is not socially acceptable sad reality
17/05/2025, 23:11 - Om Paglu: I don't think so
17/05/2025, 23:11 - Om Paglu: I really like his character
17/05/2025, 23:11 - Om Paglu: I feel he's the best fit to be someone's bf
17/05/2025, 23:12 - Parth Bansal: See let's not discuss why om is socially unacceptable one word and is he has no time to commit he is so focused on gambling
17/05/2025, 23:12 - Om Paglu: That's what everyone likes na
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Parth Bansal: No ppl like commitment
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Om Paglu: Not really
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Om Paglu: I hate commitment
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Om Paglu: So does Om
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Parth Bansal: If you have no time to commit then why be in a relationship <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Parth Bansal: It doesn't make sense <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 23:13 - Om Paglu: Aise hi
17/05/2025, 23:14 - Om Paglu: Once in 2 weeks time commitment for 30 mins is enough
17/05/2025, 23:14 - Om Paglu: Or maybe 1 hr
17/05/2025, 23:15 - Parth Bansal: Wtf that's not even basic just frnds  level commitment
17/05/2025, 23:15 - Om Paglu: I meant meeting
17/05/2025, 23:15 - Parth Bansal: What will you do in that time 30 mins not enough time to hangout
17/05/2025, 23:15 - Om Paglu: Rest everyday u can talk on phone for around 10-30 mins
17/05/2025, 23:16 - Om Paglu: Just sit and rest then
17/05/2025, 23:16 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣
17/05/2025, 23:16 - Parth Bansal: That's not commitment you cannot physically commit 30 mins that below the least count
17/05/2025, 23:16 - Parth Bansal: So it doesn't count
17/05/2025, 23:17 - Om Paglu: That's why I say I m not ready for a relationship rn
17/05/2025, 23:17 - Om Paglu: So is Om
17/05/2025, 23:17 - Om Paglu: Yeah ppl can...
17/05/2025, 23:19 - Parth Bansal: Bro i don't understand this. How long one would research in a day maybe say 8hrs sleep 7 hrs so you still have 9 hrs give 3 hrs to eating taking a bath etc

17/05/2025, 23:19 - Om Paglu: So I never want to b again
17/05/2025, 23:20 - Om Paglu: In that 6 hrs sleep na🤣
17/05/2025, 23:20 - Parth Bansal: So you are a very unproductive individual no successful has ever existed that sleeps 13 hrs day
17/05/2025, 23:20 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣

17/05/2025, 23:32 - Om Paglu: Aero passions I meant
17/05/2025, 23:33 - Parth Bansal: See i don't understand why would someone want their partner to be in the same field i have never talked to a person so adamant about their partner being in the same field as them
17/05/2025, 23:34 - Parth Bansal: Actually many ppl like opposite fields rather than same ones
17/05/2025, 23:34 - Om Paglu: So that we can discuss the same things and research together
17/05/2025, 23:34 - Om Paglu: In and out of home
17/05/2025, 23:35 - Parth Bansal: Why would someone want a partner to discuss their research work what's the point of chat gpt then
17/05/2025, 23:35 - Om Paglu: Bro u don't get it
17/05/2025, 23:35 - Om Paglu: Continuously working together
17/05/2025, 23:36 - Parth Bansal: Ohh
17/05/2025, 23:36 - Om Paglu: So now u get it
17/05/2025, 23:36 - Om Paglu: No one is like Om
17/05/2025, 23:36 - Om Paglu: So it's better to b single
17/05/2025, 23:36 - Parth Bansal: Hmm it's better to ask om
17/05/2025, 23:36 - Om Paglu: Ask what?find me a partner?
17/05/2025, 23:37 - Om Paglu: Or ask him whether anyone like him exists?🤣
17/05/2025, 23:37 - Parth Bansal: How close frnds are u with Om
17/05/2025, 23:37 - Om Paglu: Like not too close
17/05/2025, 23:37 - Om Paglu: Just like I m with hen
17/05/2025, 23:38 - Om Paglu: Or slightly closer than that
17/05/2025, 23:39 - Parth Bansal: Nahh I was thinking if you were closed enough frnds with Om ask him only that wbi a relationship
17/05/2025, 23:39 - Om Paglu: See all girls might have approached him
17/05/2025, 23:40 - Om Paglu: And he rejected everyone
17/05/2025, 23:40 - Parth Bansal: Your are extremely delusional
17/05/2025, 23:40 - Om Paglu: So there's nothing more in asking
17/05/2025, 23:40 - Om Paglu: Arey it's obvious na
17/05/2025, 23:40 - Parth Bansal: Or is this supposed to be funny
17/05/2025, 23:40 - Om Paglu: Bcoz it's very rare to get a gem like him,and once a girl gets him,why will she leave him
17/05/2025, 23:41 - Parth Bansal: Nahh not obvious
I think your definition of obvious is what you think you would die that in a situation
17/05/2025, 23:41 - Om Paglu: Maybe Shreya also approached him before approaching Karan
17/05/2025, 23:41 - Parth Bansal: But no one meets him
17/05/2025, 23:41 - Om Paglu: Why??
17/05/2025, 23:41 - Parth Bansal: Sad
17/05/2025, 23:41 - Om Paglu: But he rejected Shreya too...bcoz Shreya is too rude and not that passionate about anything
17/05/2025, 23:42 - Parth Bansal: Becoz he would not want to distract himself from the path of gambling so he would try and stay away as far as possible
17/05/2025, 23:42 - Parth Bansal: Was she rude to you or ur just guessing
17/05/2025, 23:42 - Om Paglu: U know what... don't tell this to anyone
17/05/2025, 23:42 - Parth Bansal: Okay i won't
17/05/2025, 23:42 - Om Paglu: In our hostel,many girls find her rude
17/05/2025, 23:43 - Om Paglu: And no one likes her bcoz of this
17/05/2025, 23:43 - Om Paglu: And she's moody too
17/05/2025, 23:43 - Om Paglu: Noooo
17/05/2025, 23:43 - Om Paglu: That's why he rejected them?
17/05/2025, 23:43 - Parth Bansal: Becoz if what
17/05/2025, 23:43 - Om Paglu: Bcoz she is rude
17/05/2025, 23:44 - Parth Bansal: No he wouldn't want to come anywhere near the huzz to get distracted so need to reject
17/05/2025, 23:44 - Parth Bansal: Yea i wanna know why do you think she is moody
17/05/2025, 23:44 - Parth Bansal: Like rude

17/05/2025, 23:45 - Om Paglu: She speaks only when she feels like...rest of the time,she just ignores
17/05/2025, 23:45 - Om Paglu: Not true,he might have spoken to all girls,bcoz he spoke to me numerous times
17/05/2025, 23:46 - Parth Bansal: Becoz he might think of you as junior who wants help but real huzz is different <This message was edited>
17/05/2025, 23:47 - Om Paglu: Yeah maybe

20/05/2025, 23:43 - Om Paglu: So sad😭
20/05/2025, 23:44 - Parth Bansal: See that's why I suggest staying always from errants
20/05/2025, 23:44 - Om Paglu: But why will I even tolerate him for a second
20/05/2025, 23:44 - Om Paglu: See first of all he can't hit me
20/05/2025, 23:44 - Parth Bansal: Yea so for not tolerating just complain
20/05/2025, 23:44 - Parth Bansal: Why can't he?
20/05/2025, 23:44 - Om Paglu: Bcoz just like I said I have strong connections
20/05/2025, 23:45 - Om Paglu: So rn partially his future is in my hands
20/05/2025, 23:45 - Om Paglu: Now it's up to him...
20/05/2025, 23:45 - Parth Bansal: Bro connections can only help him go to jail not saving you
20/05/2025, 23:45 - Om Paglu: Not only that... connections can ensure that he's jobless forever
20/05/2025, 23:46 - Parth Bansal: Nahh ain't no way
20/05/2025, 23:46 - Om Paglu: See i don't want to elaborate my connections
20/05/2025, 23:46 - Om Paglu: But I can ensure that'll surely happen
20/05/2025, 23:46 - Om Paglu: Actually that's why he came
20/05/2025, 23:47 - Parth Bansal: What did he say?
20/05/2025, 23:47 - Om Paglu: He asked for forgiveness
20/05/2025, 23:47 - Parth Bansal: Were you talking to him just before you went offline for a sec
20/05/2025, 23:47 - Parth Bansal: Then what did you say
20/05/2025, 23:47 - Om Paglu: When??
20/05/2025, 23:47 - Om Paglu: I said u should have thought before doing all these
20/05/2025, 23:48 - Parth Bansal: .
20/05/2025, 23:48 - Parth Bansal: Here you went offline for a sec
20/05/2025, 23:48 - Parth Bansal: I don't think you should ruin his career and let him to his fate
20/05/2025, 23:48 - Om Paglu: Then I said,u wanted to hit me,right?so basically if it wasn't iitm campus with no securities,u would have raised ur hands, right
20/05/2025, 23:49 - Om Paglu: So why will I forgive u,huh?
20/05/2025, 23:49 - Om Paglu: Just get lost if u don't want to make it look worse
20/05/2025, 23:50 - Om Paglu: But at the same time I don't want to ruin other ppl 's future as well...like he might b doing the same with interns as well
20/05/2025, 23:51 - Parth Bansal: But he is not like ruining careers he is asking to do SMTH that be might be unrelated to project but can be dealt with you can ensure that he might be stripped off his ability to become a guide that's it
20/05/2025, 23:51 - Parth Bansal: But he really is a psycho
20/05/2025, 23:51 - Parth Bansal: Bro wanted to hit a girl 10 years younger
20/05/2025, 23:52 - Om Paglu: No i meant,he might b forcing ppl to do his task and if ppl ignores,he might hit them
20/05/2025, 23:52 - Om Paglu: In case he becomes a prof ever
20/05/2025, 23:52 - Om Paglu: Not only that...u know what else he did

20/05/2025, 23:53 - Om Paglu: Then he said i m not paying attention
20/05/2025, 23:53 - Om Paglu: Then I questioned his abilities immediately
20/05/2025, 23:54 - Om Paglu: After an argument,he finally agreed that it was his fault though 🤣
20/05/2025, 23:54 - Parth Bansal: Were you paying attention?
20/05/2025, 23:54 - Om Paglu: Obviously

22/05/2025, 12:44 - Om Paglu: That means it depends on chemical??
22/05/2025, 12:44 - Parth Bansal: Aree it means the chemical and aero industry are similar 
They depend on maths
22/05/2025, 12:45 - Om Paglu: 😭😭

25/05/2025, 11:58 - Parth Bansal: Isn't it crazy creating something better than humans 
Which has conscience and knows what's good or bad neutrally
25/05/2025, 11:59 - Om Paglu: Yeah i m not at all interested in that...I uld prefer mechanical part of robot

25/05/2025, 12:00 - Parth Bansal: It can be potentially dangerous also because then humans would be the second most intelligent beings on the planet earth

25/05/2025, 12:00 - Om Paglu: But I don't like to implement it

25/05/2025, 15:18 - Parth Bansal: Equal rights for men and women
25/05/2025, 15:18 - Parth Bansal: But they already are

25/05/2025, 15:19 - Om Paglu: So if girls r called bro why not boys called behen... isn't this a discrimination
25/05/2025, 15:19 - Parth Bansal: What's your feminst view on alimony?
25/05/2025, 15:19 - Om Paglu: That's the worst thing ever.This should be abolished asap
25/05/2025, 15:19 - Parth Bansal: As long as it is not causing harm to anyone it's practically irrelevant
25/05/2025, 15:19 - Om Paglu: The girls should b given a verdict of death
25/05/2025, 15:20 - Om Paglu: Shut up!!
25/05/2025, 15:20 - Parth Bansal: If some one feels bad then it's bad
25/05/2025, 15:20 - Om Paglu: Ok i m feeling bad about this
25/05/2025, 15:20 - Om Paglu: So isn't it bad?

25/05/2025, 15:21 - Parth Bansal: Yea it's bad but i have already asked you
25/05/2025, 15:21 - Parth Bansal: You are fine with it
25/05/2025, 15:21 - Parth Bansal: You only told you are fine being called bro

25/05/2025, 15:48 - Parth Bansal: should be given
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Parth Bansal: death sentence
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Parth Bansal: its not practical
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Om Paglu: Why not
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Om Paglu: It's the worst thing one could ever imagine
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Om Paglu: Like for me
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Om Paglu: If I uld ever marry someone
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Parth Bansal: some moms leave their jobs for their babys and when they get divorced they deserve some alimony because she should have been earning
25/05/2025, 15:48 - Om Paglu: I uld never take alimony
25/05/2025, 15:49 - Om Paglu: Exactly that's the thing...why did u leave ur job
25/05/2025, 15:49 - Om Paglu: I hate women like them
25/05/2025, 15:49 - Parth Bansal: to take care of your baby..
25/05/2025, 15:49 - Om Paglu: How could u prioritize baby over job
25/05/2025, 15:49 - Om Paglu: Maybe u could have appointed a nanny
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Parth Bansal: see that's the problem if the baby is not spending time with parents its sad
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Parth Bansal: nanny
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Parth Bansal: sad
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Om Paglu: Why to fucking care about the baby
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Om Paglu: The baby is not ur own life
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Parth Bansal: lol becoz the baby is your baby so care is necessary
25/05/2025, 15:50 - Om Paglu: And why should mom spend time, even the dad can do so
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Parth Bansal: yea but generally dad is earning more so mom leaves the job
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Om Paglu: Holy crap!!fuck of
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Om Paglu: I won't agree
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Om Paglu: Who said dad always earns more
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Parth Bansal: whoever is earning more
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Parth Bansal: generally
25/05/2025, 15:51 - Om Paglu: Shut up
25/05/2025, 15:52 - Parth Bansal: bro see i can't even participate in logical debate with you, you get angry instead of giving logics thats not how a debate works
25/05/2025, 15:52 - Om Paglu: 😡
25/05/2025, 15:53 - Parth Bansal: why angry?
25/05/2025, 15:53 - Om Paglu: See first of all I uld like u to understand
25/05/2025, 15:53 - Om Paglu: A baby has no significance in a girls life
25/05/2025, 15:53 - Om Paglu: A baby is neither a part of a person 's life
25/05/2025, 15:53 - Parth Bansal: and is that why baby is given to mom and not dad after a divorce?
25/05/2025, 15:54 - Parth Bansal: nor ..
25/05/2025, 15:54 - Om Paglu: A baby is neither important in a mom nor in a dad's life
25/05/2025, 15:54 - Om Paglu: But they can't just throw that fucking mistake
25/05/2025, 15:55 - Om Paglu: So they find girls r weak... that's why they hand over them to girls
25/05/2025, 15:55 - Om Paglu: But if I m ever a mom,in this case I uld give it to it's surrogate mother or keep it in an orphanage
25/05/2025, 15:55 - Parth Bansal: i dont think a baby can be a mistake its a well thought of decision
25/05/2025, 15:56 - Om Paglu: Yuck!! Who can ever have this nonsense decision
25/05/2025, 15:56 - Parth Bansal: see thats the problem now you are thinking from your perspective try to think generally
25/05/2025, 15:57 - Om Paglu: Yeah... that's a general thought
25/05/2025, 15:57 - Om Paglu: Say first of all
25/05/2025, 15:57 - Parth Bansal: not to have babies after marriage is a general thought ? how is this world going on then?
25/05/2025, 15:57 - Om Paglu: If u r not mad, obviously u won't carry a baby,right? just go for surrogacy
25/05/2025, 15:58 - Om Paglu: Get a surrogate mom to do that job
25/05/2025, 15:58 - Om Paglu: Maybe they r forced
25/05/2025, 15:58 - Om Paglu: But normal ppl like me completely despise this thought
25/05/2025, 15:58 - Parth Bansal: so you donate your sperm and a different mom carries my baby in her womb?
25/05/2025, 15:59 - Om Paglu: Yup...why to go through maternity changes in body
25/05/2025, 15:59 - Om Paglu: This is my body...why will a shit ruin it
25/05/2025, 16:00 - Om Paglu: Atleast u agree to this,right
25/05/2025, 16:00 - Parth Bansal: No
25/05/2025, 16:00 - Parth Bansal: i don;t
25/05/2025, 16:00 - Om Paglu: Abey...why not 🤣🤣
25/05/2025, 16:00 - Parth Bansal: i want my wife to carry my baby not anyone else
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Om Paglu: See from a man's view as well...
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Om Paglu: If ur wife carries ur baby
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Parth Bansal: because after pregnancy a woman heals it not a permanent thing
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Om Paglu: Then atleast u need to spend time in taking care of her during pregnancy,right?
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Om Paglu: So why waste 9 months
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Om Paglu: Huh?
25/05/2025, 16:01 - Om Paglu: Still...9 months
25/05/2025, 16:02 - Parth Bansal: yea obv fulfill anything she wants
25/05/2025, 16:02 - Om Paglu: Atleast for girls thinking about this is the worst thing ever
25/05/2025, 16:02 - Om Paglu: Hmm... that's why it's better to go for surrogacy
25/05/2025, 16:03 - Parth Bansal: that is what creates a mom a mom the affection mom has towards a child most of it is I believe created during this period only
25/05/2025, 16:03 - Om Paglu: We'll accept any other hormonal changes...but changes bcoz of a mistake is not at all acceptable
25/05/2025, 16:03 - Om Paglu: Why to gain affection for a parasite
25/05/2025, 16:03 - Parth Bansal: the real desire selfless behavior of mom towards her child is created during this period only
25/05/2025, 16:04 - Om Paglu: Whatever...maybe I won't ever understand 🤣
25/05/2025, 16:04 - Parth Bansal: see i understand you don't want to have a child its completely fine
25/05/2025, 16:04 - Om Paglu: Bcoz i myself hate children neither do i want to b a mom ever🤣
25/05/2025, 16:04 - Parth Bansal: yea u won't understand
25/05/2025, 16:05 - Om Paglu: Yeah...id think the sacrifice towards this can b sufficed ever
25/05/2025, 16:05 - Om Paglu: So do u
25/05/2025, 16:05 - Parth Bansal: yea that is what makes the bond between a mom and a child the way it is poetically described
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Om Paglu: What if she doesn't want to??
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Om Paglu: Yuck!!
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Parth Bansal: then i won't marry her i will ask the question before hand
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Om Paglu: Bro...
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Parth Bansal: yes
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Om Paglu: But I thought it's hen
25/05/2025, 16:06 - Om Paglu: Don't u love him?
25/05/2025, 16:07 - Parth Bansal: bro thats all jokes but now im a serious man
25/05/2025, 16:07 - Om Paglu: Uhh fine
25/05/2025, 16:07 - Om Paglu: If I ever marry,the only question I'll ask is
25/05/2025, 16:07 - Om Paglu: I'll b busy in my own career...hope u won't expect anything frm me
25/05/2025, 16:07 - Parth Bansal: yea all these questions are absolutely necessary
25/05/2025, 16:08 - Om Paglu: Else just back off bcoz i don't wanna ruin ur career
25/05/2025, 16:08 - Parth Bansal: yea good ask this beforehand
25/05/2025, 16:08 - Om Paglu: Like absolutely nothing...not even staying together everyday
25/05/2025, 16:09 - Om Paglu: Or say I m working with a male lab partner and sleeping in lab, hope u won't create a huge fuss out of this trivial thing
25/05/2025, 16:09 - Om Paglu: What do u think they'll say?
25/05/2025, 16:10 - Parth Bansal: prolly no
25/05/2025, 16:10 - Om Paglu: Then wdy think will I b single forever?
25/05/2025, 16:10 - Om Paglu: That's actually the best life i feel
25/05/2025, 16:11 - Om Paglu: Btw what's the meaning of 😶
25/05/2025, 16:11 - Parth Bansal: Yea
25/05/2025, 16:11 - Om Paglu: Bro...since u made me happy <This message was edited>
25/05/2025, 16:12 - Om Paglu: Party
25/05/2025, 16:12 - Parth Bansal: So u give na
25/05/2025, 16:13 - Om Paglu: Nah
25/05/2025, 16:13 - Om Paglu: U give
25/05/2025, 16:13 - Parth Bansal: Nobody cares about this
But i don't think there is a point of marriage If you expect nothing from your partner
25/05/2025, 16:13 - Om Paglu: Actually right
25/05/2025, 16:14 - Om Paglu: I mean emotional connection?
25/05/2025, 16:14 - Om Paglu: Suppose if u feel low or if u go bankrupt or if u lose hope of success?
25/05/2025, 16:14 - Om Paglu: Then partner can help u,right?
25/05/2025, 16:15 - Parth Bansal: This is more selfish than anything I would say 
Ur not willing to give 0.1% of your time and you expect them to help you when you're feeling low
How do u even think of that?
25/05/2025, 16:15 - Om Paglu: I meant
25/05/2025, 16:15 - Om Paglu: If they need me during these times
25/05/2025, 16:15 - Om Paglu: I can help them
25/05/2025, 16:15 - Om Paglu: That's what I meant 🤣

28/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: Like in general
28/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: What if I kiss?
28/05/2025, 22:15 - Parth Bansal: Hmm so how does one depict deep emotional connection in hug
28/05/2025, 22:15 - Parth Bansal: Om would go mad
28/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: Wait...
28/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: Why Om?
28/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: I meant sneezy
28/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: Why though?
28/05/2025, 22:16 - Parth Bansal: Ohh fuck i thought Om, bechara Om would get harrassed
28/05/2025, 22:16 - Parth Bansal: First kiss
28/05/2025, 22:18 - Om Paglu: Why??
28/05/2025, 22:18 - Om Paglu: Abey
28/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: It's not first
28/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: For him
28/05/2025, 22:19 - Parth Bansal: How do u know
28/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: Bcoz when he was born,his parents kissed him first
28/05/2025, 22:19 - Parth Bansal: Damn girl 
You got that girl math running
28/05/2025, 22:20 - Om Paglu: 🤣
28/05/2025, 22:20 - Parth Bansal: You are too good
28/05/2025, 22:20 - Om Paglu: At what?
28/05/2025, 22:20 - Parth Bansal: I think you should meditate
28/05/2025, 22:20 - Om Paglu: Why should I? <This message was edited>
28/05/2025, 22:21 - Parth Bansal: Or maybe take sanyas like IIT baba for 5 days that would help heal your brain
28/05/2025, 22:21 - Om Paglu: But, what's wrong with me??
28/05/2025, 22:21 - Parth Bansal: .
28/05/2025, 22:21 - Parth Bansal: Your logic is very solid
28/05/2025, 22:21 - Om Paglu: Yeah... everyone's parents kiss them first
28/05/2025, 22:22 - Om Paglu: Then comes siblings and close relatives
28/05/2025, 22:22 - Parth Bansal: Too solid for normal below avg humans <This message was edited>
28/05/2025, 22:22 - Om Paglu: What's wrong with my logic?
28/05/2025, 22:22 - Parth Bansal: .
28/05/2025, 22:22 - Om Paglu: Everyone got numerous kisses
28/05/2025, 22:22 - Om Paglu: It's a fact
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: U too
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Ur sista too
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Me too
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Om too
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Hen too
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Parth Bansal: Hmm see nthng is wrong with your logic but it's too good for a below avg human like me
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: And what about Om?
28/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: Read gita
28/05/2025, 22:24 - Parth Bansal: Om is god he invented the word logic
28/05/2025, 22:24 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣
28/05/2025, 22:24 - Om Paglu: Where does he sleep though?
28/05/2025, 22:24 - Om Paglu: Who does he spend time with?
28/05/2025, 22:24 - Parth Bansal: I already told u this
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Parth Bansal: Maybe somewhere in the clouds some aero nerds might call that LEO
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: Wtf!!🤣🤣
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Parth Bansal: Deciding every human's future
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Parth Bansal: Om is a busy man
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: Who does he sleep with?
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Parth Bansal: Alone maybe
28/05/2025, 22:25 - Om Paglu: Isn't he a god though
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Parth Bansal: Yea
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Om Paglu: But initially he used to sleep with his mom
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Om Paglu: And dad maybe
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Om Paglu: The first ppl who held him
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Parth Bansal: <Media omitted>
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Parth Bansal: 😂
28/05/2025, 22:26 - Om Paglu: Another logic
28/05/2025, 22:27 - Parth Bansal: Bro what if I was like devyansh
28/05/2025, 22:27 - Om Paglu: See Om's parents must have been very overjoyed to hold and raise him
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Since the day he was born
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Or maybe even before that
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Parth Bansal: Hmm okay good to know
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Wdym??
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Parth Bansal: What if I didn't talk to my old frnds is that good
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Om Paglu: Obviously not
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Parth Bansal: So I should not be like devyansh => 
So I should talk to my old frnd => bye
28/05/2025, 22:28 - Parth Bansal: Bye billu billi
28/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: Wtf!!
28/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: What r u even saying??
28/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: If u don't wanna speak to me,tell me immediately
28/05/2025, 22:31 - Om Paglu: Else Om will curse u
28/05/2025, 22:31 - Parth Bansal: <Media omitted>
28/05/2025, 22:32 - Om Paglu: Only if I was Om's elder sister or younger sister!!
28/05/2025, 22:32 - Om Paglu: Who's that?
28/05/2025, 22:32 - Parth Bansal: My frnd
28/05/2025, 22:32 - Om Paglu: Ohh nice
28/05/2025, 22:33 - Om Paglu: I uld have kissed him sooooo much since his birth.....
28/05/2025, 22:33 - Om Paglu: Cute Ommy❤️❤️
28/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Only if he was my relative😔
28/05/2025, 22:35 - Om Paglu: Even if the whole world is against him, I'll try to protect him with all my life
29/05/2025, 00:41 - Parth Bansal: Bro what do u even want to say?
29/05/2025, 00:41 - Om Paglu: That he's so cute

29/05/2025, 00:41 - Parth Bansal: Bro see I was talking to my frnd and u thought
29/05/2025, 00:41 - Parth Bansal: I don't wanna talk to u
29/05/2025, 00:41 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣
29/05/2025, 00:42 - Parth Bansal: I talked to him for more than 2 hrs
29/05/2025, 00:42 - Parth Bansal: That's crazyy
29/05/2025, 00:42 - Om Paglu: School friend?
29/05/2025, 00:42 - Om Paglu: Kash devyansh was like that
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Parth Bansal: But see u were like this
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Parth Bansal: U were judging
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Om Paglu: I wasn't
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Om Paglu: I was just kidding
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Parth Bansal: Nahh my one and only best frnd
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Om Paglu: I mean I got it
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Parth Bansal: He was the person I can say that was my true best frnd
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Om Paglu: Ohh
29/05/2025, 00:43 - Om Paglu: See i don't want to sound rude or anything
29/05/2025, 00:44 - Om Paglu: But after whatever my ex Best friend and boy friend did
29/05/2025, 00:44 - Om Paglu: After that honestly I don't expect anything frm anyone
29/05/2025, 00:44 - Om Paglu: Matlab even if u ignored me,I uldnt have been surprised
29/05/2025, 00:45 - Om Paglu: *same goes with Om
29/05/2025, 00:45 - Parth Bansal: Lol bro is prepared now
29/05/2025, 00:45 - Om Paglu: Yup...
29/05/2025, 00:46 - Parth Bansal: If I'm ignores u
29/05/2025, 00:46 - Parth Bansal: I don't think u will be able to handle it
29/05/2025, 00:46 - Om Paglu: Why??
29/05/2025, 00:47 - Parth Bansal: I mean I can't say becoz i don't that much about u but it would be pretty difficult
29/05/2025, 00:47 - Parth Bansal: Harder than when devyansh stopped talking
29/05/2025, 00:47 - Om Paglu: U mean u or Om?
29/05/2025, 00:47 - Parth Bansal: But that's negative thoughts u should think
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Parth Bansal: Yea
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Parth Bansal: Om
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Om Paglu: Both?
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Parth Bansal: I meant om
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Parth Bansal: This fking autocorrect
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Om Paglu: Obviously I'll
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Om Paglu: B able to handle it
29/05/2025, 00:48 - Om Paglu: Bcoz i expect nothing from anyone anymore
29/05/2025, 00:49 - Parth Bansal: Nice it's better to be that way
29/05/2025, 00:49 - Om Paglu: Like honestly speaking even if he weds someone else,maybe I'll b sad for sometime,but won't affect me too much
29/05/2025, 00:49 - Om Paglu: Bcoz at the end of the day i expect nothing from him
29/05/2025, 00:50 - Om Paglu: Do u know what exactly he meant to me?
29/05/2025, 00:50 - Om Paglu: Do u know how i felt?
29/05/2025, 00:50 - Parth Bansal: Na but you have talked a lot more about om
29/05/2025, 00:50 - Parth Bansal: Than him
29/05/2025, 00:51 - Parth Bansal: So maybe Om is a better frnd to lose
29/05/2025, 00:51 - Om Paglu: At this point no one matters to me
29/05/2025, 00:51 - Om Paglu: Few days ago
29/05/2025, 00:51 - Om Paglu: Devyansh suddenly contacted me
29/05/2025, 00:51 - Parth Bansal: Then
29/05/2025, 00:51 - Om Paglu: Then nothing...I just answered his questions, didn't speak anything else
29/05/2025, 00:52 - Om Paglu: He's sensed something was wrong
29/05/2025, 00:52 - Om Paglu: So he asked me what exactly
29/05/2025, 00:52 - Parth Bansal: So
29/05/2025, 00:52 - Parth Bansal: What did u say
29/05/2025, 00:52 - Om Paglu: Then I told him I m done with confronting him with the same thing over and again
29/05/2025, 00:53 - Om Paglu: Also I said since he's happy with his present,maybe he shouldn't turn back to the past
29/05/2025, 00:55 - Parth Bansal: Bro wtf if he's trying to start a conversation why would u say something like that
But idk the whole story so maybe ur right can't say nothing
29/05/2025, 00:55 - Om Paglu: Bcoz earlier when I used to call me
29/05/2025, 00:55 - Om Paglu: He said he was always busy since his friends were calling him
29/05/2025, 00:55 - Parth Bansal: ??
29/05/2025, 00:56 - Om Paglu: On the other hand whenever he used to call me,i left everything aside only for him
29/05/2025, 00:56 - Om Paglu: Maybe it was my fault...
29/05/2025, 00:56 - Om Paglu: Whatever... ultimately it was i who was hurt,so it's better if I don't walk on the same path
29/05/2025, 00:57 - Parth Bansal: Maybe
29/05/2025, 00:58 - Om Paglu: U know how hurt i was
29/05/2025, 00:58 - Parth Bansal: I can't rlly comprehend because I have never had such an experience
29/05/2025, 00:58 - Om Paglu: See I m telling u one thing, after whatever happened...I have completely lost faith in ppl
29/05/2025, 00:59 - Om Paglu: So maybe I can never trust ppl again
29/05/2025, 00:59 - Om Paglu: Hope u don't have one
29/05/2025, 00:59 - Om Paglu: +whenever we used to hang out afterwards
29/05/2025, 00:59 - Om Paglu: He was always busy texting ppl on his phone
29/05/2025, 01:00 - Parth Bansal: See it's not like that it's about trying to put a little trust and seeing how that person responds and is he is good then trying to put a Lil more trust
29/05/2025, 01:00 - Om Paglu: That's how I trusted devyansh
29/05/2025, 01:00 - Om Paglu: But then he changed
29/05/2025, 01:00 - Om Paglu: Ppl do change
29/05/2025, 01:00 - Parth Bansal: Ohh damnn then we never rlly know
29/05/2025, 01:01 - Om Paglu: Ultimately i felt like a dog who was constantly begging for his attention
29/05/2025, 01:02 - Parth Bansal: Damn can't say Nthg
29/05/2025, 01:02 - Om Paglu: That's why I don't trust anyone anymore
29/05/2025, 01:02 - Om Paglu: And relationship for me is a completely far fetched thought 🤣
29/05/2025, 01:03 - Parth Bansal: Good
29/05/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: U should also never trust anyone
29/05/2025, 01:03 - Parth Bansal: I generally never
29/05/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: Not even hen
29/05/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: Or Om
29/05/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: I know when to trust baby hen and when not to
I think I almost know everything Abt him even I can tell u in which scenario what he would say
29/05/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: I too knew everything about devyansh
29/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: I m telling u
29/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: Ppl change
29/05/2025, 01:05 - Parth Bansal: Like when u told msg him that u have a crush on him
I told u he would say that he's better and stuff like that
29/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: Hmm
29/05/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: Same goes in my case too
29/05/2025, 01:06 - Parth Bansal: Damn i should be conscious
29/05/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Yeah u should
29/05/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: I basically feel
29/05/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Devyansh got used to begging for his attention
29/05/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Maybe that's what he expected from me
29/05/2025, 01:07 - Parth Bansal: Do u beleive u were always an overthinker or u have changed or u believe that u r not an overthinkrr
29/05/2025, 01:07 - Om Paglu: I m n overthinker for sure
29/05/2025, 01:08 - Parth Bansal: Always?
29/05/2025, 01:08 - Parth Bansal: Or now?
29/05/2025, 01:08 - Om Paglu: Now
29/05/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
29/05/2025, 01:09 - Parth Bansal: So what u think
Do i overthink?
29/05/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: Something a bit yeah
29/05/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: Like sneezy
29/05/2025, 01:10 - Parth Bansal: I think that I don't think I think I am an underthinker but sometimes maybe i think a bit too much
29/05/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: Hmm, whatever
29/05/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: Like fluffy
29/05/2025, 01:11 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
29/05/2025, 01:11 - Parth Bansal: Yo such a random photo to send brdr
29/05/2025, 01:11 - Om Paglu: Guess why I sent u this
29/05/2025, 01:11 - Parth Bansal: I think that ur back at the place where u sleep and u wanna sleep
29/05/2025, 01:11 - Om Paglu: What!!
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Parth Bansal: U were walking and now ur back at the resting place
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Om Paglu: Nooooo
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Om Paglu: These r Om's shoes
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Om Paglu: Why r his feet so small
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Parth Bansal: U can't tell from the pic 
Looks are deceiving
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Om Paglu: Yeah true
29/05/2025, 01:12 - Om Paglu: Baby feet
29/05/2025, 01:13 - Om Paglu: Implies baby Om
29/05/2025, 01:13 - Parth Bansal: Trust shoes look small when u try to fit you foot in there it suddenly suffices
29/05/2025, 01:13 - Om Paglu: No
29/05/2025, 01:13 - Om Paglu: For girls, it's the opposite
29/05/2025, 01:14 - Parth Bansal: Is it?
29/05/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Atleast i experienced that
29/05/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Several times
29/05/2025, 01:14 - Parth Bansal: My leg is like a 9 or 10 UK size and shoes sometimes like small sometimes they look big as fuck <This message was edited>
29/05/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: I miss him so much
29/05/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Ohh
29/05/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: Bro thinking about him won't help
29/05/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: Its bad for you
29/05/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: See if I ever get a bf,u have to throw a party
29/05/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: Do u know who I m talking about
29/05/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: I'm fine with it it's not happening
29/05/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: That's why I said na🤣🤣
29/05/2025, 01:16 - Parth Bansal: Whoever it is regardless its bad it's either cats Om devyansh or last option ur ex
29/05/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: Btw,how did u know I won't get one...m i that ugly and passionless 😭
29/05/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: Yeah true
29/05/2025, 01:17 - Parth Bansal: Naa it's not about looks it's about willingness to get one
You are unwilling as you yourself said
29/05/2025, 01:17 - Om Paglu: Ohh in that way
29/05/2025, 01:18 - Om Paglu: Very much unwilling
29/05/2025, 01:18 - Om Paglu: As much as I m willing for aero
29/05/2025, 01:18 - Parth Bansal: Its also less about looks and passionless thing, it's about looks only to a certain extent after that it's a lot about personality
29/05/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: And my personality is very bad??
29/05/2025, 01:19 - Parth Bansal: Bro I'm not saying that
29/05/2025, 01:19 - Parth Bansal: I said your parameter of judgement
29/05/2025, 01:19 - Parth Bansal: Are wrong in my opinion they might be right for right some ppl <This message was edited>
29/05/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: Yeah I got ur point

29/05/2025, 01:20 - Parth Bansal: Every possible way that has ever existed
29/05/2025, 01:20 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣

30/05/2025, 10:35 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣
30/05/2025, 10:36 - Parth Bansal: I personally would have let him continue with a red flag like if he ever does this again he won't be able to do his PhD
30/05/2025, 10:38 - Om Paglu: U think he's going to listen in that way
30/05/2025, 10:39 - Parth Bansal: Everyone should be given one chance in my opinion

30/05/2025, 10:41 - Parth Bansal: Yes
30/05/2025, 10:41 - Parth Bansal: Ik
30/05/2025, 10:42 - Om Paglu: Not even to Om

30/05/2025, 11:15 - Om Paglu: Just now
30/05/2025, 11:15 - Om Paglu: He took me very lightly
30/05/2025, 11:15 - Parth Bansal: What did you say and when did he say after that
30/05/2025, 11:16 - Om Paglu: First of all he didn't read the research paper I sent him, secondly he didn't want to clear my doubts,thirdly he didn't want to discuss things with me
30/05/2025, 11:17 - Om Paglu: See now I have nothing to do...he brought on his own failure...I gave him many chances,he didn't bother at all
30/05/2025, 11:26 - Parth Bansal: maybe after that he didn't want to do business with you
30/05/2025, 11:26 - Parth Bansal: fine
30/05/2025, 11:26 - Parth Bansal: sad for him
30/05/2025, 11:29 - Om Paglu: Maybe...but he could have told it directly na

30/05/2025, 13:16 - Om Paglu: Matlab so many doubts...vaise these r research based doubts1
30/05/2025, 13:16 - Om Paglu: Will he b able to?idts

30/05/2025, 13:28 - Om Paglu: U know what happened...PhD guide ne bola either simulate it wherever u feel like Varna make an engine and test it <This message was edited>
30/05/2025, 13:28 - Om Paglu: I was like..."son of a fucking bitch"
30/05/2025, 13:29 - Om Paglu: Then he said i told u too much already,after this if u can't do it, it's up to u
30/05/2025, 13:29 - Om Paglu: Then I said this
30/05/2025, 13:31 - Parth Bansal: Him!?
30/05/2025, 13:31 - Om Paglu: Phd
30/05/2025, 13:31 - Parth Bansal: U said this!?
30/05/2025, 13:31 - Om Paglu: Yup
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Parth Bansal: On his face
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Om Paglu: Can u imagine how frustrated i was
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Om Paglu: Obviously
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Parth Bansal: Ya
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Om Paglu: He was too cold
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Om Paglu: Other PhD ppl r much better than him
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Parth Bansal: I don't see the problem because i don't know this stuff
30/05/2025, 13:32 - Om Paglu: He doesn't even want to entertain my doubts
30/05/2025, 13:33 - Om Paglu: Not does he want to discuss
30/05/2025, 13:33 - Om Paglu: He just demotivates me
30/05/2025, 13:33 - Parth Bansal: What did he say after that tho
30/05/2025, 13:33 - Om Paglu: By saying my doubts r just useless, instead i should focus on more important things
30/05/2025, 13:34 - Om Paglu: Instead of pondering over doubts
30/05/2025, 13:34 - Om Paglu: Then I directly told him...maybe u did stuffs like these, that's why ur concept is hollower than space
30/05/2025, 13:35 - Om Paglu: Bcoz he didn't tell me where to stimulate,also making an engine from scratch is not what an intern is supposed to do
30/05/2025, 13:36 - Om Paglu: Bcoz i need to make my own modifications,not follow the traditional one
30/05/2025, 13:36 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
30/05/2025, 13:36 - Parth Bansal: I kinda get what you are saying
30/05/2025, 13:37 - Om Paglu: Also I called him a moron today

31/05/2025, 20:27 - Parth Bansal: No idea what's that is
31/05/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: Have to start everything from scratch
31/05/2025, 20:28 - Parth Bansal: That's what I love learning things from scartch
31/05/2025, 20:28 - Om Paglu: It's a software for calculating many things...mine was flame temperature in combustion chamber and nox concentration in exhaust flame
31/05/2025, 20:29 - Om Paglu: Bro...it basically meant i need to change my conditions in combustion chamber
31/05/2025, 20:29 - Parth Bansal: Bhai ye toh normal hai aise toh Teri zindagi sad hi rahegi
31/05/2025, 20:29 - Parth Bansal: Ur planning to be a researcher

31/05/2025, 20:30 - Om Paglu: Like try to make completely new and better conditions
31/05/2025, 20:30 - Om Paglu: That's not what I meant
31/05/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: We need to keep on changing conditions and find the accurate conditions
31/05/2025, 20:31 - Parth Bansal: Ik what u mean I can relate
31/05/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: And write a research paper on that
31/05/2025, 20:31 - Parth Bansal: That's called fine tuning
31/05/2025, 20:31 - Parth Bansal: It's a very important part in ML to
31/05/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: Ohh i see
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: Whenever u encounter such stuff you can train a ML model
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: To do this stuff
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: Even if u do this stuff rn
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: It won't matter
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: AI would do it much better
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: What's that?
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: Machine learning model like neural networks
31/05/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: That's what I was studying today
31/05/2025, 20:33 - Om Paglu: Why?
31/05/2025, 20:33 - Om Paglu: For sos?
31/05/2025, 20:34 - Parth Bansal: SoC

31/05/2025, 20:36 - Parth Bansal: That's what everyone says
31/05/2025, 20:36 - Om Paglu: Putting values on chatgpt
31/05/2025, 20:36 - Om Paglu: Arey listen to the whole thing first
31/05/2025, 20:36 - Parth Bansal: Bro chatgpt is not a neural network trained to do this
31/05/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: They are not using an ideal strategy
31/05/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: They should train their own neutral network
31/05/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: Then taking values from chatgpt, putting it on nasa cea and finally copying it on research paper
31/05/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: But I don't prefer that,bcoz
31/05/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: For hard stuff chatgpt will fail
31/05/2025, 20:38 - Parth Bansal: Bcoz
31/05/2025, 20:38 - Om Paglu: When u do accurate calculations, approximate values and get correct results on nasa cea,the happiness is profound
31/05/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: Correct results in the sense whatever u expected
31/05/2025, 20:39 - Parth Bansal: Hmm true
31/05/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: Then what's a good option?
31/05/2025, 20:40 - Parth Bansal: .
31/05/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: Matlab doing everything on their own?
31/05/2025, 20:40 - Parth Bansal: It may sound intimidating but it can be done
31/05/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: Obviously
31/05/2025, 20:41 - Parth Bansal: Like done by a normal person also

31/05/2025, 21:30 - Parth Bansal: If you know that you are going to lose ur pet then why have a pet just go play with random cats
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Parth Bansal: Yea it's more practical way of dealing with things
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Parth Bansal: It's a bit hard to digest
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Om Paglu: Shut up😡
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Parth Bansal: Sad
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Om Paglu: If that's the truth
31/05/2025, 21:31 - Om Paglu: Then why marry...stay alone forever
31/05/2025, 21:32 - Om Paglu: Bcoz she might leave u anyday
31/05/2025, 21:32 - Parth Bansal: Wtf? Can u play with random girls on the street you mad girl?
31/05/2025, 21:32 - Om Paglu: When did I say that
31/05/2025, 21:32 - Parth Bansal: Yea you have to choose a keeper. <This message was edited>
31/05/2025, 21:32 - Om Paglu: I said stay alone forever
31/05/2025, 21:33 - Om Paglu: Matlab she might leave this earth, thus breaking ur heart
31/05/2025, 21:33 - Om Paglu: Isn't it more practical
31/05/2025, 21:33 - Parth Bansal: Bro just think
31/05/2025, 21:33 - Parth Bansal: I don't think I need to answer that
31/05/2025, 21:33 - Parth Bansal: It's too bad of an argument
31/05/2025, 21:34 - Om Paglu: See I m telling u,once u adopt a pet,u don't feel like it's an animal
31/05/2025, 21:34 - Om Paglu: It becomes ur sibling
31/05/2025, 21:34 - Om Paglu: Slowly it becomes even more affectionate
31/05/2025, 21:35 - Om Paglu: There's nothing to think about it
31/05/2025, 21:37 - Parth Bansal: See what's wrong with your human argument is that
1.) humans tend to live longer generally 
2.)you can't have fun with random ppl on the streets
3.)with animals it's a one way thing even if it starts to get two way it's rlly cannot be compared to human two way love
31/05/2025, 21:37 - Om Paglu: I feel 2nd point is absolutely wrong
31/05/2025, 21:37 - Parth Bansal: Whatt
31/05/2025, 21:37 - Om Paglu: Fun??
31/05/2025, 21:37 - Parth Bansal: Yes like hangout
31/05/2025, 21:37 - Om Paglu: Real fun is something else
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: .
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Parth Bansal: It's subjective
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Parth Bansal: Leave it
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: That's not even close to real fun
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: Real fun is when u gain enlightenment
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Parth Bansal: . Leave it I don't think it's worth discussing
31/05/2025, 21:38 - Om Paglu: Wait...for that friends r there na
31/05/2025, 21:39 - Parth Bansal: Friends change
31/05/2025, 21:39 - Om Paglu: So does everyone
31/05/2025, 21:39 - Parth Bansal: There is a difference in committing
31/05/2025, 21:39 - Parth Bansal: Friends don't commit to nothing
31/05/2025, 21:39 - Om Paglu: Yup...fair enough
31/05/2025, 21:40 - Om Paglu: That's the logic devyansh gave once
31/05/2025, 21:40 - Parth Bansal: Yea i also feel the same
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Parth Bansal: Yea how do you gain enlightenment with ur partner?
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Parth Bansal: It's an individual thing
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Om Paglu: But Om doesn't feel the same
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Om Paglu: That's what I said na...no need to have a partner
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Parth Bansal: See again fun is subjective
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Parth Bansal: I'm telling you
31/05/2025, 21:41 - Om Paglu: Yeah, maybe
31/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
31/05/2025, 21:42 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
31/05/2025, 21:43 - Parth Bansal: The question was why marry 
Marrying involves being in a relationship 
If u want enlightenment I don't think you should be thinking about marriage or smth it's not a valid question for a monk
If the question is marriage then fun must be taken into care and by fun I mean like almost objective fun like what everyone enjoyes
31/05/2025, 21:44 - Om Paglu: That's what I have trying to explain...u should never marry
31/05/2025, 21:44 - Om Paglu: Just like Om and me
31/05/2025, 21:45 - Parth Bansal: Damn good for you guys
31/05/2025, 21:45 - Om Paglu: U know Aaron Bensier?

31/05/2025, 21:45 - Om Paglu: Why?
31/05/2025, 21:45 - Parth Bansal: Because that's what you like
31/05/2025, 21:45 - Om Paglu: U know Manishika?
31/05/2025, 21:45 - Parth Bansal: I think you wrote her name wrong maybe
31/05/2025, 21:46 - Om Paglu: Just imagine we become sanyasis at the same place <This message was edited>
31/05/2025, 21:46 - Om Paglu: Why?
31/05/2025, 21:46 - Om Paglu: Om and i

But I'm just saying for future purposes pls give full context
31/05/2025, 22:10 - Om Paglu: So whatever impression u have about him is the way I portray him
31/05/2025, 22:10 - Om Paglu: That's why he was shocked
31/05/2025, 22:10 - Om Paglu: Not about u
31/05/2025, 22:10 - Om Paglu: But me...
31/05/2025, 22:11 - Om Paglu: Like u know what...I m telling u
31/05/2025, 22:11 - Parth Bansal: See it's fine
31/05/2025, 22:11 - Om Paglu: Most ppl in college thinks he's too much egoistic
31/05/2025, 22:11 - Parth Bansal: Maybe he is who knows
31/05/2025, 22:11 - Om Paglu: But since I had been in the same situation
31/05/2025, 22:11 - Om Paglu: Those ppl calls me his female version
31/05/2025, 22:12 - Parth Bansal: Hmm are you always having a beef with someone
31/05/2025, 22:12 - Om Paglu: I understand him properly... it's not egoistic, it's just focusing on own self
31/05/2025, 22:12 - Om Paglu: This thing is misunderstood as ego
31/05/2025, 22:12 - Om Paglu: Same in my case too
31/05/2025, 22:13 - Parth Bansal: They are completely different things and mutually exclusive
31/05/2025, 22:13 - Parth Bansal: See ego and narcissism are different things
31/05/2025, 22:13 - Om Paglu: Not really...see suppose I don't behave properly with someone and someone feels I m rude and too proud of myself
31/05/2025, 22:14 - Om Paglu: But actually it's just that I m not even paying attention to what the person is saying,I m just in my own world
31/05/2025, 22:14 - Parth Bansal: Does that make you driven passionate or focused on own self no right 
So they are mutually exclusive
31/05/2025, 22:14 - Parth Bansal: That's just rude
31/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: Nah bro...I don't find anything wrong in this
31/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: That's how we like to be
31/05/2025, 22:15 - Parth Bansal: Bro if you don't wanna talk why are you even in the conversation
31/05/2025, 22:15 - Parth Bansal: It's basic
31/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: See that's not the thing
31/05/2025, 22:15 - Om Paglu: Suppose we r sitting alone on our own
31/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: Then someone comes and constantly speaks to us
31/05/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: Obviously we can't force them to leave,can we
31/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: Or say we r working on a project,and say suppose we need help in coding part so we recruit a coder,then this person wants to work on aerodynamics as well
31/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: Then obviously we won't let him do our work, should we?
31/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: These r mistaken by ego by normal ppl
31/05/2025, 22:17 - Om Paglu: And ppl even call me his female version 😭
31/05/2025, 22:18 - Parth Bansal: If someone is constantly talking there are less number of such ppl who would randomly come sit in a grp and talk too much
31/05/2025, 22:18 - Parth Bansal: How the hell is that even related to not paying attention to what they are saying
31/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: This is a different case
31/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: I stated 2 examples
31/05/2025, 22:19 - Om Paglu: Unluckily we met those ppl
31/05/2025, 22:20 - Parth Bansal: Damn too bad
31/05/2025, 22:20 - Parth Bansal: I think you say very generic sentences keeping very 0.1% peculiar type of examplez
31/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: See basically idk why
31/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: But we like to stay on our own
31/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: We don't want a huge crowd
31/05/2025, 22:23 - Parth Bansal: That's nice
31/05/2025, 22:23 - Om Paglu: But who gave u his number? rajdeep?

So I never loved this kind of personality I always prefer humble personalities that's why I never wanted him to win
Like in the qualifier one also he was mocking a debutant because he was water boy and he has fights with almost everyone 
He never won trophy as a captain that's says a lot about leadership skills

04/06/2025, 18:31 - Parth Bansal: U change your stance every 5 seconds
04/06/2025, 18:32 - Om Paglu: lol...those don't even come from my heart
04/06/2025, 18:32 - Om Paglu: honestly I know what I want
04/06/2025, 18:32 - Om Paglu: and I won't be changing that
04/06/2025, 18:32 - Parth Bansal: Yeah but the sheer thought of contradicting urself every 5 secs in enormous amount of ways is something u can do that's crazyy
04/06/2025, 18:33 - Om Paglu: those changes r just jokes...I thought u got it
04/06/2025, 18:33 - Parth Bansal: Yeahh bro ik
04/06/2025, 18:33 - Parth Bansal: Ik the ground truth
04/06/2025, 18:33 - Parth Bansal: But sometimes I myself get confused
04/06/2025, 18:33 - Om Paglu: huh?why not?it's just something I say but can't never accept or follow
04/06/2025, 18:34 - Om Paglu: and that is?
04/06/2025, 18:34 - Parth Bansal: U know cmon bro like depends on what aspect
04/06/2025, 18:34 - Om Paglu: just give an example
04/06/2025, 18:34 - Parth Bansal: See ur very straight forward from outside like superficially
04/06/2025, 18:35 - Parth Bansal: See it's very clear u like aero and hate chemical
04/06/2025, 18:35 - Om Paglu: lol...🤣🤣
04/06/2025, 18:35 - Om Paglu: isit good or bad?
04/06/2025, 18:35 - Om Paglu: obviously...
04/06/2025, 18:36 - Parth Bansal: Its good
04/06/2025, 18:37 - Parth Bansal: See many topics are very obv
But Om is a very like mind bending topic 
Ur relation with Om is like one of the 7 million dollars problem
04/06/2025, 18:38 - Om Paglu: Finally atleast some good character
04/06/2025, 18:39 - Om Paglu: Ok fine...u want to know the truth
04/06/2025, 18:39 - Om Paglu: And why I do it in that way
04/06/2025, 18:39 - Parth Bansal: Yea but see the truth u tell me might change seconds later
04/06/2025, 18:39 - Parth Bansal: I want to know this primarily
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Om Paglu: obviously not
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Parth Bansal: It's like the truth is a variable that depends on many features 
Like mood past the day and a lot of other factors 
So truth is a function of time
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Om Paglu: if I tell the truth,it'll come from the heart
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Parth Bansal: Ok tell let's see
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Parth Bansal: And u will stick to it
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Om Paglu: but since u don't believe me
04/06/2025, 18:41 - Om Paglu: what's the point of saying😭
04/06/2025, 18:42 - Parth Bansal: Say na that would be another experience and a machine learns from experimental truth
04/06/2025, 18:42 - Parth Bansal: So that will be another data point
04/06/2025, 18:42 - Om Paglu: tf!!
04/06/2025, 18:42 - Om Paglu: what r u saying??
04/06/2025, 18:42 - Om Paglu: so basically u mean I m a liar?
04/06/2025, 18:43 - Parth Bansal: See u sometimes speak aero sometimes i speak ML only sometimes tho
04/06/2025, 18:43 - Parth Bansal: Naa
04/06/2025, 18:43 - Parth Bansal: I will tell in detail what i mean
04/06/2025, 18:45 - Parth Bansal: You only said sometimes u get overwhelmed by emotions that are the mood and what happened on that particular day and that influences what u think
So whats wrong with what i said
04/06/2025, 18:50 - Parth Bansal: So it really is the truth so this doesn't make u a liar
This is what normally humans are like
04/06/2025, 18:50 - Om Paglu: Damn!!why have u started writing an essay
04/06/2025, 18:50 - Om Paglu: Lemme read all these now
04/06/2025, 18:51 - Om Paglu: Huh?
04/06/2025, 18:51 - Om Paglu: Truth is what happened,no matter what
04/06/2025, 18:51 - Om Paglu: Controlling emotions is very important for a sanyasi
04/06/2025, 18:52 - Parth Bansal: Yea so ur trying to control na u can't completely control
04/06/2025, 18:52 - Parth Bansal: So not a liar but it's just that frequency of change of truth is a lil fast
04/06/2025, 18:52 - Om Paglu: Then I uld have become a sanyasi by now
04/06/2025, 18:53 - Om Paglu: Just MDD things
04/06/2025, 18:53 - Parth Bansal: MDD is a basic drug that I'm supposed to know?
04/06/2025, 18:53 - Om Paglu: What??
04/06/2025, 18:53 - Parth Bansal: What's MDD
04/06/2025, 18:54 - Om Paglu: MDD is major depression disorder <This message was edited>

04/06/2025, 19:26 - Om Paglu: Umm... actually I m much better
04/06/2025, 19:27 - Om Paglu: Like josaa thoughts don't come every now and then
04/06/2025, 19:27 - Om Paglu: But when someone associates me with chemical,it results in a great outburst... implying I m not completely fine now
04/06/2025, 19:59 - Parth Bansal: Ohh okay
04/06/2025, 20:08 - Om Paglu: U see most ppl think mental illness is just a joke
04/06/2025, 20:09 - Om Paglu: But it's much serious

04/06/2025, 20:09 - Om Paglu: Most ppl don't
04/06/2025, 20:09 - Parth Bansal: It's like worse in some ways than physical pain also
04/06/2025, 20:09 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
04/06/2025, 20:09 - Parth Bansal: Because u can't fucking get urself to do anything
04/06/2025, 20:09 - Om Paglu: Some ways??I feel all ways
04/06/2025, 20:10 - Om Paglu: To reduce mental pain,I used to physically hurt myself
04/06/2025, 20:10 - Om Paglu: Some marks still persist
04/06/2025, 20:10 - Parth Bansal: It just depends on the amount of physical pain like if u have an accident which is like after that u have to cut a limb of then that is worse
04/06/2025, 20:11 - Om Paglu: Haan obviously
04/06/2025, 20:12 - Parth Bansal: Marks ?
04/06/2025, 20:12 - Parth Bansal: Like how much physical pain did u inflict on urself
04/06/2025, 20:16 - Om Paglu: I m not talking about that serious
04/06/2025, 20:16 - Om Paglu: Just normal pains
04/06/2025, 20:19 - Om Paglu: Yup
04/06/2025, 20:19 - Om Paglu: If u don't experience it,u won't understand 😭

04/06/2025, 23:47 - Parth Bansal: About
04/06/2025, 23:48 - Om Paglu: for the past 2 days I have been having dreams about...
04/06/2025, 23:51 - Om Paglu: continuously😭
04/06/2025, 23:51 - Om Paglu: don't know why
05/06/2025, 07:14 - Parth Bansal: ..
05/06/2025, 10:06 - Om Paglu: The scariest and worst thing ever
05/06/2025, 12:39 - Om Paglu: Today a freshie asked me for josaa advice
05/06/2025, 12:39 - Om Paglu: I told her to go for iitm aero
05/06/2025, 12:39 - Om Paglu: Or iitm mech
05/06/2025, 12:57 - Om Paglu: Didn't I do the right thing
05/06/2025, 12:57 - Om Paglu: ?
05/06/2025, 13:09 - Om Paglu: Yesterday also someone asked
05/06/2025, 13:09 - Om Paglu: I said take aero at whichever college u get
05/06/2025, 13:21 - Parth Bansal: I think
05/06/2025, 13:22 - Parth Bansal: U should refrain from advising tbh because wtf
If they had no interest in aero why would they take aero 
Doesn't make sense 
U should ask them what they like and tell them to research about branches <This message was edited>
05/06/2025, 13:23 - Parth Bansal: Given the context which is you didn't care about their interest this can potentially be very dangerous advice
05/06/2025, 13:23 - Om Paglu: Bro...
05/06/2025, 13:23 - Om Paglu: They just said they wanted cse only
05/06/2025, 13:24 - Om Paglu: And they r not getting it
05/06/2025, 13:24 - Om Paglu: So it doesn't matter what they take now
05/06/2025, 13:25 - Om Paglu: Yeah yeah...I told them about aero and how it can affect their future
05/06/2025, 13:26 - Parth Bansal: Why bro if they take circuital branch it's better
05/06/2025, 13:26 - Om Paglu: They rnt getting that too
05/06/2025, 13:27 - Parth Bansal: It might help them with maths
05/06/2025, 13:27 - Parth Bansal: What are they getting
05/06/2025, 13:27 - Om Paglu: They r getting mechanical and branches above that
05/06/2025, 13:27 - Parth Bansal: Below*
05/06/2025, 13:27 - Om Paglu: Hmm hmm
05/06/2025, 13:29 - Om Paglu: They were also open to go to tier 2 iits or iitkgp and iitg for circuital
05/06/2025, 13:29 - Om Paglu: But I told them not to take anything other than iitb,iitm,iitd and iitk
05/06/2025, 13:30 - Parth Bansal: Why iitg is good
05/06/2025, 13:30 - Om Paglu: Nah
05/06/2025, 13:30 - Om Paglu: It's not that recognised out of India
05/06/2025, 13:33 - Parth Bansal: Not everyone wants to go outside India
05/06/2025, 13:35 - Om Paglu: Still ...
05/06/2025, 13:35 - Om Paglu: Iitg isn't that good
05/06/2025, 13:36 - Om Paglu: For masters,ur btech degree doesn't really matter,but iit tag does
05/06/2025, 13:42 - Parth Bansal: Damn if they are hell-bend on taking CS then they prolly don't want to do masters
05/06/2025, 13:43 - Parth Bansal: That's what I think
05/06/2025, 13:43 - Parth Bansal: But who knows
05/06/2025, 13:44 - Om Paglu: Why?
05/06/2025, 13:45 - Parth Bansal: Becoz ppl take CS becoz placements and if they are looking to get placed then why would they study?
05/06/2025, 13:50 - Om Paglu: Hmm,makes sense
05/06/2025, 13:50 - Om Paglu: Then why do they even want iit?
05/06/2025, 13:52 - Om Paglu: R they as crazy as Om?
05/06/2025, 13:54 - Parth Bansal: Becoz it's easier to get placed
05/06/2025, 13:58 - Om Paglu: Oh is it??
05/06/2025, 13:58 - Om Paglu: I told them branch doesn't matter for placements
05/06/2025, 14:11 - Parth Bansal: It does obv but like having CS in a very random clg does prolly mean nothing
05/06/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: Hmm i see
05/06/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: If anyone asks me for advice on placements and all,can I give them ur number?
05/06/2025, 15:21 - Parth Bansal: Na bro I'm also busy can't help with stuff it's too complicated
05/06/2025, 15:21 - Parth Bansal: Or maybe
05/06/2025, 15:21 - Parth Bansal: U can
05/06/2025, 16:52 - Om Paglu: Ohk fine
05/06/2025, 16:52 - Om Paglu: I'll give Om's number
05/06/2025, 17:17 - Om Paglu: I m missing my home now ...will try to complete internship asap and go back
05/06/2025, 22:19 - Parth Bansal: Is this not a fixed time thing

It's kind of pointless looking at people's performance last year
For you to qualify to the finalis this year, it depends on the scores of the candidate pool this year 

Don't take too much stress over this
Just go brush up on your high school concepts and solve some good problems :)
That'll help you more

18/06/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: Nah bhai
18/06/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: U know that depends on lots of factors
18/06/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: See basically there's a myth that
18/06/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: Madras is south
18/06/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: So culture is very bad
18/06/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: And food as well

21/06/2025, 01:01 - Om Paglu: Ik...but u were irritated,right?
21/06/2025, 01:01 - Parth Bansal: What happened
21/06/2025, 01:01 - Om Paglu: U felt like why is she talking about someone else continuously,like does she even consider me a friend
21/06/2025, 01:01 - Om Paglu: Right?
21/06/2025, 01:02 - Parth Bansal: I understood that ur going thru smth I was not irritated but it gave me a feeling that SMTH is going on
21/06/2025, 01:02 - Parth Bansal: I don't think this much
21/06/2025, 01:02 - Om Paglu: But I used to send things about him continuously
21/06/2025, 01:02 - Parth Bansal: I only thought what's so special about this Om guy then one by one you told everything <This message was edited>
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: But I m genuinely sorry
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: I won't do it anymore
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Parth Bansal: Suddenly
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: Neither will I do it to anyone else
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: I realised how ppl got irritated
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Om Paglu: And stopped considering me a friend
21/06/2025, 01:03 - Parth Bansal: How did u come to this realisation
21/06/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: .
21/06/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: Yea how did u come to this realisation
21/06/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: Did someone tell u that
21/06/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: Ayush told me
21/06/2025, 01:04 - Parth Bansal: That ..
21/06/2025, 01:04 - Om Paglu: I m becoming like a robot
21/06/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: Comparing ppl with Om
21/06/2025, 01:05 - Om Paglu: And making ppl feel inferior
21/06/2025, 01:05 - Parth Bansal: Ohh maybe he felt a bit sad nvm 
but yeah if u are constantly talking Abt someone else this can make u lose friends
21/06/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: But how?
21/06/2025, 01:06 - Parth Bansal: Did u compare him to Om?
21/06/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Yup
21/06/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Like I said
21/06/2025, 01:06 - Om Paglu: Try to be like Om
21/06/2025, 01:07 - Parth Bansal: Because suppose say I talk to hen 
Then I talk to hen to talk to him not to talk about his frnd whom I don't even know so if he keeps mentioning his frnd then why would I be interested to talk Abt his hypothetical frnd <This message was edited>
21/06/2025, 01:07 - Om Paglu: Hmm makes sense
21/06/2025, 01:07 - Om Paglu: Sorry
21/06/2025, 01:08 - Om Paglu: I didn't realise this earlier
21/06/2025, 01:08 - Parth Bansal: Bro lol he didn't take it in a positive way koi ni
21/06/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: Like I said dedicated like On
21/06/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: And not looking out for girls
21/06/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: Unlike most ppl of our age
21/06/2025, 01:09 - Parth Bansal: He felt judged sad
21/06/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: But that's the truth
21/06/2025, 01:09 - Om Paglu: See basically
21/06/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: I feel sad to see Ayush's cpi going down drastically
21/06/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: So comparison is the only way I could think of
21/06/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: Bcoz earlier I tried to make him understand the importance of cpi in future
21/06/2025, 01:10 - Om Paglu: But he just laughed it off
21/06/2025, 01:13 - Parth Bansal: I think he hates om compare him to a random person
See Om is in the rocket team 
So whenever u feel like comparing to Om just say generic stuff like say ppl are part of tech teams so he won't feel judged to someone who actually exists <This message was edited>
21/06/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Yeah whenever I said Om is in rocket team
21/06/2025, 01:14 - Parth Bansal: Horrible english btw I'm typing with one eye closed but i think u get it
21/06/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Ayush said that's nothing
21/06/2025, 01:14 - Om Paglu: Any tech team will recognise ayush for his skills
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: Yeah yeah
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: What skills
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: Speaking
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: Technical
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: Drone skills
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Parth Bansal: Then why isn't he part of one
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: He felt applying to teams isn't worth it
21/06/2025, 01:15 - Om Paglu: That's what he said
21/06/2025, 01:16 - Parth Bansal: But the crux is make statements generic
21/06/2025, 01:16 - Parth Bansal: So he doesn't feel judged
21/06/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: See whatever I say
21/06/2025, 01:16 - Om Paglu: He just says he's better than Om in that respect
21/06/2025, 01:17 - Om Paglu: So i was left with nothing but cpi
21/06/2025, 01:17 - Parth Bansal: *Delusional*
21/06/2025, 01:17 - Om Paglu: Ikr
21/06/2025, 01:17 - Parth Bansal: Bro is an intern at isro just show some respect <This message was edited>

21/06/2025, 01:18 - Om Paglu: Ayush also got intern at sagar defence company
21/06/2025, 01:18 - Om Paglu: It was like
21/06/2025, 01:18 - Om Paglu: There's some senior who somehow contributes
21/06/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: And he saw Ayush's drone passion
21/06/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: So they let him in
21/06/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: That's why Ayush thinks getting intern is very easy
21/06/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: He literally said he'll b applying to MiT NXT year
21/06/2025, 01:19 - Parth Bansal: Bro might learn things the hard way
21/06/2025, 01:19 - Om Paglu: Yup
21/06/2025, 01:20 - Parth Bansal: Stoopid or maybe he was joking
21/06/2025, 01:20 - Om Paglu: Arey he said
21/06/2025, 01:20 - Om Paglu: He can easily get internship in universities
21/06/2025, 01:20 - Om Paglu: But he'll only accept if they sponsor everything
21/06/2025, 01:20 - Parth Bansal: Bro
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Parth Bansal: He is going to be royally fucked
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: Ikr
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Parth Bansal: But koi ni samaj aayega
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: I tried explaining the truth
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Parth Bansal: Being confident is one thing
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: Since sem 2
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Parth Bansal: Being over confident is another <This message was edited>
21/06/2025, 01:21 - Om Paglu: So i have been comparing him since sem 2
21/06/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: But he doesn't real9
21/06/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: He says Om doesn't have any social life
21/06/2025, 01:22 - Om Paglu: Yup
21/06/2025, 01:22 - Parth Bansal: Bro but brain>>>
21/06/2025, 01:23 - Om Paglu: Once I told him that getting this internship at iitm was very difficult for me
21/06/2025, 01:23 - Om Paglu: Then he said with skills nothing is difficult
21/06/2025, 01:23 - Parth Bansal: I always wonder how will I get an intern 
Her my boi is like intern ezz

21/06/2025, 01:24 - Om Paglu: He feels he's multi-talented
21/06/2025, 01:25 - Parth Bansal: *Narcissist* bolte hain ise
21/06/2025, 01:25 - Om Paglu: 😂😂
21/06/2025, 01:25 - Om Paglu: Just didn't want to use the term
21/06/2025, 01:25 - Parth Bansal: He feels that way he should first get an lor and then say how ez was it
21/06/2025, 01:25 - Om Paglu: Gives me nazi vibes
21/06/2025, 01:26 - Om Paglu: He feels all companies r after him,so r profs
21/06/2025, 01:26 - Parth Bansal: I can't judge myself but do u think I'm also narcissistic
21/06/2025, 01:26 - Om Paglu: But I m telling u
21/06/2025, 01:26 - Om Paglu: Ask him the depth of drones
21/06/2025, 01:26 - Om Paglu: He'll b dumb

21/06/2025, 01:27 - Parth Bansal: Sad then what about passion
21/06/2025, 01:27 - Om Paglu: See basically he knows the physics behind drones
21/06/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: But like for improving drones,the necessary studies and dedication required...he doesn't have that
21/06/2025, 01:28 - Parth Bansal: Normally no but one day u said SMTH that was a bit narcissistic but otherwise normal
21/06/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: Which one?
21/06/2025, 01:28 - Om Paglu: Which something?

23/06/2025, 21:28 - Om Paglu: Just imagine if Om's surname changes to something starting with M
23/06/2025, 21:28 - Om Paglu: So,his initials will be O.M.

23/06/2025, 23:53 - Om Paglu: why?traffic?
23/06/2025, 23:54 - Parth Bansal: Because when you drive at night time in your car's mirror u see nothing except headlights of car behind you so practically u can see nothing in your mirrors because your "blinded by the lights" <This message was edited>
23/06/2025, 23:55 - Om Paglu: damn!!
23/06/2025, 23:55 - Parth Bansal: Also u have to overtake at speeds of 80 kph there which is also hard
23/06/2025, 23:55 - Om Paglu: so high probability of accidents
23/06/2025, 23:55 - Parth Bansal: Yea noobs can't drive there
23/06/2025, 23:55 - Parth Bansal: It was a crazy aah experience

23/06/2025, 23:58 - Parth Bansal: In fact u shouldn't even drive there at around 4-6 pm
23/06/2025, 23:58 - Om Paglu: why?
23/06/2025, 23:58 - Parth Bansal: Only very skilled drivers should drive
23/06/2025, 23:58 - Om Paglu: bro...I m not night blind
23/06/2025, 23:59 - Om Paglu: r u skilled?
23/06/2025, 23:59 - Parth Bansal: Because peak traffic u have to move very fast and moving very involves overtaking very fast
23/06/2025, 23:59 - Parth Bansal: Not a lot but pretty well
23/06/2025, 23:59 - Om Paglu: so why did u tell me not drive
23/06/2025, 23:59 - Om Paglu: u think just bcoz I m a girl
23/06/2025, 23:59 - Om Paglu: i can't drive properly
24/06/2025, 00:00 - Parth Bansal: Because u should practice a lot before going there like atleast 6 months of practice
24/06/2025, 00:00 - Om Paglu: Om and i were planning to fly f-35 or f-22
24/06/2025, 00:00 - Parth Bansal: Didn't think of this but gr8 logic
24/06/2025, 00:00 - Om Paglu: obviously...but u said in general'
24/06/2025, 00:00 - Om Paglu: implies...
24/06/2025, 00:01 - Parth Bansal: Lol
24/06/2025, 00:01 - Parth Bansal: Stereotype is real
24/06/2025, 00:01 - Om Paglu: wdym??
24/06/2025, 00:01 - Parth Bansal: .
24/06/2025, 00:01 - Om Paglu: shut up!!

24/06/2025, 00:02 - Om Paglu: Om always think I can achieve whatever I want to...that's why we were planning to fly f-35 or f-22 together
24/06/2025, 00:03 - Parth Bansal: U two are stoopid also na
24/06/2025, 00:03 - Om Paglu: how?
24/06/2025, 00:03 - Om Paglu: and why?
24/06/2025, 00:03 - Parth Bansal: See i wanted to piss u off and i did that
24/06/2025, 00:03 - Om Paglu: bcoz we don't think like normal ppl?
24/06/2025, 00:03 - Om Paglu: bcoz we feel success can be achieved no matter what?
24/06/2025, 00:04 - Parth Bansal: Because that's an unrealistic expectation u want to become an aero prof or maybe researcher so they don't do this shit and u can't do two things at the same time
24/06/2025, 00:04 - Om Paglu: bro...
24/06/2025, 00:04 - Om Paglu: r u an idiot
24/06/2025, 00:04 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣

24/06/2025, 00:06 - Om Paglu: then we can get back to phd
24/06/2025, 00:08 - Parth Bansal: *that's not called flying for really because that's fking one time thing*
*Plus from common knowledge how would I know that u can take a break and go flying*
24/06/2025, 00:08 - Om Paglu: not becoming a fighter plane pilot or someting
24/06/2025, 00:08 - Om Paglu: just some additional skill
24/06/2025, 00:09 - Om Paglu: might be needed during ast

24/06/2025, 00:10 - Om Paglu: ohh I see

🔸 The sessions for ETABS will be conducted along with SOC and those will be pre-recruitment sessions for EERI IIT Bombay.
🔸 Further ETABS sessions specific to EERI projects will be conducted by our team and are mandatory for recruitment.

30/06/2025, 20:23 - Om Paglu: Gender cell

30/06/2025, 20:23 - Parth Bansal: What changes do u want to bring
30/06/2025, 20:23 - Om Paglu: Like security for boys too
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: So that they too r not harassed
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: Gender equality
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: Om is also with me
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Parth Bansal: What kind of measures do u want to implement
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Parth Bansal: Like what will u add in course
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Parth Bansal: How do u think they are harassed
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: .
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: I mean
30/06/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: See gc works only for females
30/06/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: I want the same measures to b brought around for boys too
30/06/2025, 20:25 - Parth Bansal: Yea what measures exactly
30/06/2025, 20:25 - Parth Bansal: ..
30/06/2025, 20:25 - Parth Bansal: ..
30/06/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: Exactly the same things that exist for females
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Parth Bansal: But i don't think a bunch of females will ever tease a boy in IIT I mean it would be rare
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Parth Bansal: But yeah
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Parth Bansal: Good measures
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Parth Bansal: Good approach
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: Exactly...then why uld u think boys will tease girls
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: It's just how the society taught u
30/06/2025, 20:27 - Om Paglu: It's not true
30/06/2025, 20:28 - Parth Bansal: That's just based off numbers
30/06/2025, 20:28 - Om Paglu: Shut up😡😡
30/06/2025, 20:28 - Om Paglu: It's not true
30/06/2025, 20:28 - Om Paglu: How do u know girls at iits have good intentions
30/06/2025, 20:28 - Parth Bansal: Bro prove logically with some numbers not with "shut up"
30/06/2025, 20:28 - Om Paglu: And boys have terrible intentions
30/06/2025, 20:29 - Om Paglu: See even if a boy is harassed, he'll never come out
30/06/2025, 20:29 - Om Paglu: Bcoz of the fear
30/06/2025, 20:29 - Om Paglu: That society is going to laugh at him
30/06/2025, 20:29 - Om Paglu: But they too r humans
30/06/2025, 20:29 - Om Paglu: They too deserve justice
30/06/2025, 20:30 - Parth Bansal: I don't know nor do I believe it either way but the chances are likely that a boy wouldn't get teased by a grp of girls if that happens then sure gc should work <This message was edited>
30/06/2025, 20:30 - Om Paglu: .
30/06/2025, 20:30 - Om Paglu: Maybe incidents like that happened
30/06/2025, 20:30 - Om Paglu: But no one knows
30/06/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: Om and I r planning to bring a change
30/06/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: Wanna join us?
30/06/2025, 20:31 - Parth Bansal: No i have better stuff to do but go ahead if u want to nothing bad at least
30/06/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: But society
30/06/2025, 20:31 - Om Paglu: Needs changes
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: Else female will start misusing these laws
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: They are already
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: I'll stand up for boys
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: Ikr
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: That's why
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: Let's start some initial changes
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: Yea go ahead
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: Will hen b interested?
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Parth Bansal: No
30/06/2025, 20:32 - Om Paglu: Why not?
30/06/2025, 20:33 - Parth Bansal: Because
30/06/2025, 20:33 - Parth Bansal: There are better ways, changing system takes time so meanwhile u can implement stuff on your own
30/06/2025, 20:33 - Om Paglu: So say
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Om Paglu: If some girls harass u
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Om Paglu: Will u be free enough to seek help?
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Parth Bansal: Idts it's possible
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Om Paglu: Answer this
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Parth Bansal: What do u think she can do to me
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Parth Bansal: I don't need help i will help myself
30/06/2025, 20:34 - Om Paglu: Force u to do something which u r not comfortable to
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: What if they blackmail u with some private vdo
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Parth Bansal: Where the fk would they get my private vdo I don't do nothing in private
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: See everything doesn't go in the way we think it to b
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: Say bathing vdo
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: Or something like that
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: Somehow
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Parth Bansal: Hmm ok
30/06/2025, 20:35 - Om Paglu: In future
30/06/2025, 20:36 - Parth Bansal: I get ur question but I can't stop laughing becoz of one thing
30/06/2025, 20:36 - Om Paglu: Bcoz of??
30/06/2025, 20:36 - Parth Bansal: I always have one piece of clothing even while bathing so no need to worry
30/06/2025, 20:36 - Parth Bansal: 😂
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: But I get your question
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: See that's not the case with everyone
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: In that case it's difficult
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: So u r comfortable with ur bathing vdo going viral,right?
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Parth Bansal: It is troublesome
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: In the same way females r harassed
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: If laws r there
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: Or maybe girls stalking u continuously
30/06/2025, 20:37 - Om Paglu: Making u feel uncomfortable
30/06/2025, 20:38 - Parth Bansal: Yea if it goes viral fk it I don't care I mean they won't blackmail me atleast because there is nothing to blackmail
But it can be troublesome for some ppl in that case it is a crime obv u can report to police or maybe gc also
30/06/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: Exactly...
30/06/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: But some boys r scared to do that
30/06/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: They think ppl might judge
30/06/2025, 20:39 - Om Paglu: .
30/06/2025, 20:39 - Parth Bansal: Bro just approach and ask what the fuck is wrong with you
30/06/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: It doesn't always happen in that way
30/06/2025, 20:40 - Om Paglu: I have seen a lot of such cases
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Parth Bansal: Bro let them stalk I go to library classes gym and room so they are public places so they have all the rights to look anywhere they want
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Parth Bansal: Except my room obv
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Om Paglu: Exactly...
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Om Paglu: They follow u in ur room too
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Parth Bansal: It's not allowed
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Parth Bansal: So not possible
30/06/2025, 20:41 - Om Paglu: Matlab,they keep an watch
30/06/2025, 20:42 - Om Paglu: From girls hostel
30/06/2025, 20:42 - Om Paglu: Or some places
30/06/2025, 20:42 - Om Paglu: And see ur room
30/06/2025, 20:42 - Parth Bansal: Just close the window I'm highly private when it comes to room I don't like others watching me I close all the doors
30/06/2025, 20:42 - Om Paglu: But imagine this happening to anyone in general
30/06/2025, 20:43 - Parth Bansal: So superficially there are very rare scenarios in which a girl can harass mainly it's blackmailing they can use
30/06/2025, 20:43 - Parth Bansal: Say two ppl are in a relationship and they do SMTH SMTH and girl accuses the boy then there isn't rlly much the boy can do she can ruin his life if she wants to
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: Any form of harassment should b abolished
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: Exactly...I m saying this too
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: Misusing of law
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Parth Bansal: Yes it happens all the time
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Parth Bansal: Nothing much can be done
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: So we need a change
30/06/2025, 20:44 - Om Paglu: It has to b done
30/06/2025, 20:45 - Parth Bansal: We need a change obv but it's hard
30/06/2025, 20:45 - Om Paglu: Else Om is going to prison
30/06/2025, 20:45 - Om Paglu: Become jyotiba and savitribai phule

04/07/2025, 14:09 - Om Paglu: See
04/07/2025, 14:09 - Om Paglu: U have a mentor,right?
04/07/2025, 14:09 - Om Paglu: So who's above the mentor?
04/07/2025, 14:09 - Parth Bansal: The MnP people

04/07/2025, 14:10 - Parth Bansal: Yea he just confirms whether the thing is right or not
04/07/2025, 14:10 - Om Paglu: See my point is that
04/07/2025, 14:10 - Om Paglu: Like in recent times
04/07/2025, 14:10 - Om Paglu: H2 combustor engines has not been implemented
04/07/2025, 14:10 - Om Paglu: But extensive research is going on
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Om Paglu: So there's no proper answer to any question
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Om Paglu: All r just research work <This message was edited>
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Parth Bansal: Hmm
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Parth Bansal: Okay
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Parth Bansal: What else
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Om Paglu: So no one can confirm the truth
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Om Paglu: The only thing u can do is discussing ur ideas with prof
04/07/2025, 14:11 - Parth Bansal: Okay I'm following
04/07/2025, 14:12 - Om Paglu: And if ur idea is great,he might implement it
04/07/2025, 14:12 - Om Paglu: And publish it in his own name
04/07/2025, 14:13 - Om Paglu: But I don't get ur point??
04/07/2025, 14:13 - Om Paglu: I mean without a prof,how can u research extensively
04/07/2025, 14:13 - Parth Bansal: My point am I supposed to make points?
04/07/2025, 14:13 - Parth Bansal: 😂
04/07/2025, 14:14 - Om Paglu: How can u publish?
04/07/2025, 14:14 - Parth Bansal: I don't do research just first of all
04/07/2025, 14:14 - Om Paglu: Bcoz if u do anything at this point (btech),u r not allowed to publish directly
04/07/2025, 14:15 - Parth Bansal: Wow didn't know this
04/07/2025, 14:15 - Om Paglu: Ur prof will publish, u'll just get a very tiny part of the credit
04/07/2025, 14:15 - Parth Bansal: Hmm can understand
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: Even I too didn't know this
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: My uncle told me
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: He's also a prof
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: So he knows about it
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: 😭
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Parth Bansal: Nice for profs
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Parth Bansal: Sad for students
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: Yup
04/07/2025, 14:26 - Om Paglu: He's going to china now
04/07/2025, 14:27 - Om Paglu: But there's an exception
04/07/2025, 14:27 - Om Paglu: For a particular person
04/07/2025, 14:27 - Parth Bansal: For whom if I may ask

04/07/2025, 14:28 - Parth Bansal: No obv I was waiting for u to type Om but when u actually typed it
04/07/2025, 14:28 - Om Paglu: It's either the publication is under PhD ppl or prof
04/07/2025, 14:28 - Om Paglu: Now for masters ppl
04/07/2025, 14:29 - Om Paglu: They include their name at last
04/07/2025, 14:29 - Om Paglu: But btech ppl r given very less credit
04/07/2025, 14:29 - Parth Bansal: How are they given credit
04/07/2025, 14:30 - Parth Bansal: Like what are they given the credit for
04/07/2025, 14:30 - Om Paglu: Yeah now suppose say ur relative is the prof,then obviously u r given deserved credit
04/07/2025, 14:30 - Om Paglu: For their entire research work and paper publication
04/07/2025, 14:31 - Om Paglu: They might include ur name somewhere in the paper...not at the title though
04/07/2025, 14:32 - Parth Bansal: Hmm credit stealers

06/07/2025, 16:49 - Om Paglu: But I hate him
06/07/2025, 16:50 - Om Paglu: That's the problem
06/07/2025, 16:50 - Om Paglu: Hi,I m Rajanya.I m from Bengal.About myself,I uld say I m more into aerospace.But I m not sure whether to do a masters in aeronautics or astronautics (yet to decide)😭
I m always up for any aero related discussion.In my free time I prefer either to dance or work on aero wala stuffs...
06/07/2025, 16:50 - Om Paglu: See i sent this in the group
06/07/2025, 16:51 - Om Paglu: Should I add:I love Om
06/07/2025, 16:51 - Parth Bansal: First of all he might not even want to be in a relationship 
Second if he wants to be in a relationship he might not want to be in one with you
Third if he wants to be in a relationship with u he might not have the confidence because u are a year younger or whatever
06/07/2025, 16:51 - Om Paglu: So many possibilities 😭😭
06/07/2025, 16:51 - Parth Bansal: Yea gotta respect my calculations
06/07/2025, 16:52 - Om Paglu: But if the 3rd point is true,like I m younger...so what?
06/07/2025, 17:00 - Parth Bansal: Bro its hella weird tbh
06/07/2025, 17:00 - Om Paglu: Why?
06/07/2025, 17:00 - Parth Bansal: Bro tbh i cant imagine
06/07/2025, 17:00 - Parth Bansal: I just dont know it is hella weird
06/07/2025, 17:01 - Om Paglu: Imagine what?
06/07/2025, 17:01 - Parth Bansal: Imagine to be in Om's place and ask someone who is a year younger out
06/07/2025, 17:01 - Om Paglu: So what's the problem
06/07/2025, 17:01 - Parth Bansal: I know there is nothing wrong with it
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Om Paglu: Rn we send each other lots of things
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Om Paglu: Reels i mean
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Om Paglu: And talk nonsense as well
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Parth Bansal: Glad u clarified
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Om Paglu: Then what's the problem
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Parth Bansal: Talking and shit is ok i mean i dont get it i know nothing wrong with it but what can i say
06/07/2025, 17:02 - Parth Bansal: Ask om
06/07/2025, 17:03 - Om Paglu: Yeah so he knows he can tell me anything
06/07/2025, 17:03 - Om Paglu: Then what's the problem in asking me out
06/07/2025, 17:03 - Parth Bansal: Suppose wait 1 sec
06/07/2025, 17:03 - Om Paglu: After all usually girls r younger than boys in relationships
06/07/2025, 17:04 - Om Paglu: +he's only few months elder to me
06/07/2025, 17:04 - Parth Bansal: Suppose he asks u out 
In a scenario where u just consider Om your friend and Om asks u out and then u would say what the fuck we were only frnds why did u suddenly do this this u fking senior weirdo and u tell all ur frnds that this this senior is a fling weirdo
06/07/2025, 17:05 - Om Paglu: Obviously no one is going to react in this way
06/07/2025, 17:05 - Om Paglu: If anyone asks me out and I think of him as a friend only
06/07/2025, 17:05 - Parth Bansal: *Obv*
06/07/2025, 17:05 - Om Paglu: I'll understand
06/07/2025, 17:05 - Om Paglu: His feelings
06/07/2025, 17:06 - Parth Bansal: What's so obv u said you said the same thing about ayush that u have told him multiple times that u are not interested in him still he is doing what he is doing so
06/07/2025, 17:06 - Om Paglu: And meet him physically and tell him that I just consider him as a friend and I'll say that let's be friends...life is so easy that way
06/07/2025, 17:06 - Parth Bansal: Tell that to ayush na
06/07/2025, 17:06 - Om Paglu: I just told u...no one else,bcoz i was confused
06/07/2025, 17:06 - Om Paglu: +he didn't ask me out
06/07/2025, 17:06 - Om Paglu: If he does then obviously I'll tell that
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Parth Bansal: He is leaning towards that only
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Om Paglu: Or maybe I m just overthinking
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Om Paglu: I mean unless he directly asks me our
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Om Paglu: I can never tell him that
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Parth Bansal: Yes thats always true regardless of what is happening these days
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Om Paglu: Yeah
06/07/2025, 17:07 - Om Paglu: 🤣🤣
06/07/2025, 17:08 - Om Paglu: Only if someone asks me out I can tell them
06/07/2025, 17:08 - Om Paglu: I just told u bcoz i wanted to know about guys mentality
06/07/2025, 17:08 - Om Paglu: Like if he directly asked me,I uld have never told u
06/07/2025, 17:08 - Parth Bansal: Ayush's case?
06/07/2025, 17:08 - Om Paglu: Yeah
06/07/2025, 17:09 - Om Paglu: I uld never have judged him
06/07/2025, 17:09 - Om Paglu: I uld have understood and tried to maintain our friendship no matter what
06/07/2025, 17:09 - Parth Bansal: I mean he very likely  wants to ask u out is what i would say but you never know im like 90% sure
06/07/2025, 17:09 - Om Paglu: Yeah that's the point...
06/07/2025, 17:09 - Om Paglu: Even I m not 100% sure
06/07/2025, 17:10 - Om Paglu: So i can't just tell him anything yet
06/07/2025, 17:10 - Parth Bansal: Yea just roll with the flow
06/07/2025, 17:10 - Om Paglu: +another reason I told u
06/07/2025, 17:10 - Om Paglu: And the main reason
06/07/2025, 17:10 - Om Paglu: Is bcoz i know u won't judge and spread rumours about him
06/07/2025, 17:10 - Om Paglu: Which most of my wingies will
06/07/2025, 17:11 - Parth Bansal: 😂 Halloween so u scared of people using your name with ayush in front of you and teasing you
06/07/2025, 17:11 - Om Paglu: Not teasing me
06/07/2025, 17:11 - Om Paglu: Just imagine he has a crush...and ppl mock him
06/07/2025, 17:11 - Om Paglu: How will he feel
06/07/2025, 17:11 - Om Paglu: That's my point
06/07/2025, 17:12 - Om Paglu: Even if ppl tease me,I can tolerate
06/07/2025, 17:12 - Om Paglu: But he'll b devastated
06/07/2025, 17:12 - Parth Bansal: Sad for him but mock him for having a crush damn
06/07/2025, 17:12 - Om Paglu: Idk...ppl might
06/07/2025, 17:12 - Om Paglu: That's why I decided to b on the safe side

06/07/2025, 17:13 - Parth Bansal: Nobody will ever know
06/07/2025, 17:13 - Om Paglu: That's why I didn't
06/07/2025, 17:13 - Om Paglu: That's what I m trying to make u understand

08/07/2025, 11:45 - Parth Bansal: U so selfish man just think from a neutral perspective
08/07/2025, 11:45 - Parth Bansal: Just be neutral for once
08/07/2025, 11:45 - Om Paglu: Then just as an excuse he said he wanted to stay there to explore other things

08/07/2025, 11:53 - Parth Bansal: Just chill
08/07/2025, 11:53 - Om Paglu: Say u like someone
08/07/2025, 11:53 - Om Paglu: And he behaves in that way
08/07/2025, 11:54 - Parth Bansal: He shuld be technically
08/07/2025, 11:54 - Parth Bansal: More worried
08/07/2025, 11:54 - Om Paglu: Huh?
08/07/2025, 11:54 - Parth Bansal: Because u talk to ayush thrice a week om vdo call
08/07/2025, 11:54 - Parth Bansal: So it means he shuld ne more insecure
08/07/2025, 11:54 - Om Paglu: But Om doesn't know about it
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Parth Bansal: So what but the truth remains na
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Om Paglu: But we r just friends
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Parth Bansal: Yea fking pussy argument he can say that too
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Om Paglu: And I m not like extending my stay for ayush
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Om Paglu: Or something
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Om Paglu: I was free,so I was talking
08/07/2025, 11:55 - Parth Bansal: Bro it just depends where u draw the line
08/07/2025, 11:56 - Parth Bansal: Everybody's lines are different
08/07/2025, 11:56 - Om Paglu: Wdym?
08/07/2025, 11:56 - Om Paglu: Maybe I'll just ask him directly...do u have a gf or a crush
08/07/2025, 11:56 - Parth Bansal: Like for u talking thrice a week on vdo call might not be much and extending stay is a big deal so line is drawn somewhere in between that
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: For him the line might be different
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: Also who knows
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: Whether he likes someone or not
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Om Paglu: .
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: Yea yea
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: Best option
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Om Paglu: And I'll just confess directly
08/07/2025, 11:57 - Om Paglu: I have stopped that now
08/07/2025, 11:58 - Parth Bansal: No ask him na first
08/07/2025, 11:58 - Parth Bansal: Why show ur cards this early in the game
08/07/2025, 11:58 - Om Paglu: Yeah, that's better
08/07/2025, 11:59 - Om Paglu: What if he says yes
08/07/2025, 11:59 - Parth Bansal: Then just accept and cry maybe nothing can be done
08/07/2025, 11:59 - Parth Bansal: Maybe help him
08/07/2025, 11:59 - Om Paglu: No...then I'll kill the other person
08/07/2025, 11:59 - Om Paglu: Ezz

08/07/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: Or maybe now that I was thinking about it
08/07/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: Maybe i never truly liked Om
08/07/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: Wow thats crazy
08/07/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: U talk about him 24/7

08/07/2025, 12:04 - Om Paglu: Maybe it's just revenge
08/07/2025, 12:04 - Om Paglu: Now I feel

08/07/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: Bcoz i believed him
08/07/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: I didn't even care when he went out with his female friends
08/07/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: Aacha i didnt know this

08/07/2025, 22:35 - Parth Bansal: But like u doubt a lot before being sure
08/07/2025, 22:36 - Parth Bansal: Like bro cant even click a picture with his team now

08/07/2025, 22:37 - Parth Bansal: Wow wtf how does it matter
08/07/2025, 22:37 - Parth Bansal: Even one bit <This message was edited>
08/07/2025, 22:37 - Om Paglu: See there were only 10 ppl,thike
08/07/2025, 22:37 - Om Paglu: Among them only 2 girls
08/07/2025, 22:37 - Parth Bansal: Yeah
08/07/2025, 22:38 - Om Paglu: Also I heard from my friends that Shrestha doesn't work properly...she just talks to aero seniors about courses and how to get good grade
08/07/2025, 22:38 - Parth Bansal: Ok
08/07/2025, 22:38 - Om Paglu: Like in the team meets
08/07/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: And when the pic was taken,they were in OAT
08/07/2025, 22:39 - Parth Bansal: Ok
08/07/2025, 22:39 - Om Paglu: +Shrestha was standing behind Om, implies they were talking just before the pic was clicked
08/07/2025, 22:40 - Om Paglu: And also when the static test was done
08/07/2025, 22:40 - Om Paglu: Shrestha was the only girl who was there
08/07/2025, 22:40 - Om Paglu: And she was standing just adjacent to Om
08/07/2025, 22:41 - Parth Bansal: Ok so what's new it is the same thing na
08/07/2025, 22:41 - Parth Bansal: U overthink a lot
08/07/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: Why does she stand beside him in all pics
08/07/2025, 22:41 - Om Paglu: That means
08/07/2025, 22:42 - Parth Bansal: How does it matter
08/07/2025, 22:42 - Om Paglu: They r very close
08/07/2025, 22:42 - Om Paglu: That means something might b going on
08/07/2025, 22:42 - Om Paglu: Maybe Shrestha has a crush on him
08/07/2025, 22:42 - Om Paglu: But whatever Om did in Ritthika's case is super sus
08/07/2025, 22:43 - Parth Bansal: I dont think u can live a happy life with this attitude although im in position to comment but just my opinion
08/07/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: See just like I said
08/07/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: I didn't behave in this way with my ex
08/07/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: Like I didn't care at all who he roamed around with
08/07/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: But this case is so different
08/07/2025, 22:44 - Parth Bansal: No yea ok that i heard but still this is too much like bro cant even stand close to someone
08/07/2025, 22:44 - Om Paglu: 🤣

08/07/2025, 22:46 - Parth Bansal: Yea sometimes i imagine
08/07/2025, 22:46 - Om Paglu: Shrestha liking Om and he liking Ritthika
08/07/2025, 22:47 - Om Paglu: And Ritthika liking someone else
08/07/2025, 22:47 - Om Paglu: And it ends in a loop,where the last person likes Shrestha
08/07/2025, 22:47 - Parth Bansal: Bro be making some goofy aah chain reaction
08/07/2025, 22:47 - Parth Bansal: That would be fking crazy

Turbojet engines play a crucial role in air transportation, providing superior thrust-to-weight ratios and lower 
NOx emissions compared to gas turbine engines, particularly at high speeds. Although they are efficient, environmental concerns and rising fuel costs have led to the exploration of alternative fuels.
This research internship focused on the simulation and thermodynamic analysis of various power cycles and the performance modeling of a modern turbofan engine using different blends of CH4 and H2. 
Initially, classical thermodynamic cycles — including Brayton, Otto, and Diesel — were modeled and analyzed using DWSIM to build foundational understanding of cycle behavior.
\\

\hspace*{5cm}The second phase of the project involved developing a Python-based simulation of a turbofan engine operating on methane, hydrogen, and their blends. The model incorporated detailed combustion calculations using Cantera to account for variations in flame temperature, equivalence ratio, and fuel composition. Key performance metrics such as specific thrust, thermal efficiency, turbine work, and emissions were evaluated. The study highlights how fuel composition and operating parameters impact engine performance, aiming to provide insights for low-emission, high-efficiency propulsion systems using hydrogen-methane based fuel.
\\

\hspace*{5cm}The third and the final phase mainly focused on mean line modelling of radial inflow turbine, mainly focusing on the real life losses encountered.

\subsection*{1) Modeling of Turbofan Engines Using Hydrogen-Methane Blends for Sustainable Aviation}

The aviation industry is heavily reliant on gas turbine propulsion systems, with turbofan engines being the most commonly used configuration in commercial and military aircraft. Their high bypass ratio, fuel efficiency, and ability to deliver large amounts of thrust make them ideal for long-range, high-subsonic flight. Over the years, improvements in turbofan design have led to better performance and noise reduction, helping meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards.
\\
\hspace*{5cm}Despite these advances, the environmental footprint of aviation remains a major global concern. Conventional aviation fuels, derived from fossil sources, contribute significantly to carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions, and NO\textsubscript{x} emissions from high-temperature combustion can lead to ozone formation and other atmospheric effects. In light of these challenges, there is growing interest in the adoption of alternative fuels, especially hydrogen, because of their potential for zero-carbon combustion and high specific energy content.

\\
\hspace*{5cm}However, transitioning to hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuels introduces new complexities. These include issues related to combustion stability, flame speed, NO\textsubscript{x} formation, fuel storage, and delivery. One promising near-term approach is the use of hydrogen-methane fuel blends, which can combine the cleaner combustion characteristics of hydrogen with the stable and well-understood behavior of methane.
\\
\\
\hspace*{5cm}This project focuses on evaluating the performance of a turbofan engine operating with various blends of hydrogen and methane. The study integrates thermodynamic cycle modeling with chemical kinetics-based combustion analysis using Cantera, an open-source simulation platform. The engine model includes key components such as the compressor, combustion chamber, turbines, and nozzle, with a detailed analysis of how the fuel composition and equivalence ratio ($\phi$) influence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Thrust generation
    \item Specific fuel consumption
    \item Thermal and propulsive efficiencies
    \item Exhaust temperature and emission trends (e.g., NO\textsubscript{x} formation)
\end{itemize}

The goal is to assess the feasibility of using hydrogen-rich fuels in aviation gas turbines and to identify optimal operating conditions that balance performance and emissions. This work supports ongoing research efforts in the field of sustainable aviation propulsion systems, and contributes to the broader vision of achieving low-emission or carbon-neutral air travel in the near future.
\\
\\
\subsection*{2) Radial Inflow Turbines in Compact Gas Turbine Applications}

In parallel with the study of hydrogen-fueled turbofan engines, a supplementary component of this internship involved the analytical modeling of radial inflow turbines (RITs). These turbines are widely employed in small-scale and micro gas turbine engines, turbochargers, and auxiliary power units due to their compact geometry, ease of manufacturing, and high power-to-weight ratio.

Unlike axial turbines, radial inflow turbines redirect flow from a radial to an axial direction, enabling high expansion ratios within a single stage. Their ability to accommodate large enthalpy drops makes them especially suitable for compact engine architectures and distributed propulsion systems — areas of growing interest in sustainable aviation.

The literature indicates that radial turbines exhibit strong performance at lower mass flow rates and rotational speeds, which are common in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hybrid-electric propulsion systems, and micro gas turbines. Key design parameters affecting RIT performance include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Turbine pressure ratio
    \item Rotor inlet and exit velocity triangles
    \item Blade speed ratio and relative Mach number
    \item Isentropic efficiency
\end{itemize}

As part of this project, mean-line modeling techniques were used to analyze radial turbine behavior over a range of pressure ratios. This included computing thermodynamic work output, generating efficiency curves against blade speed ratio, and plotting velocity triangles — based on methodologies outlined in Section 3.1 of a reference thesis provided by the supervising faculty. These insights contribute to the understanding of small-scale turbine performance and serve as a foundation for future work involving integrated cycle designs or CFD-based optimization.

\section{\textbf{Brayton Cycle:}}
\cite{naggas}
The Brayton cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic cycle for gas turbine engines. It comprises four main processes: isentropic compression, constant pressure heat addition, isentropic expansion, and constant pressure heat rejection. It is widely used in the  propulsion systems of  turbofan and turbojet engines as well as stationary gas turbines.Though in case of turbojet and turbofan engines,it is portrayed as an open brayton cycle.The schematic diagram is as shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]

% Axes

\draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4) node[above] {Pressure};

\draw[thick,->] (3) -- node[right] {Expansion} (4);
\draw[thick,->] (4) -- node[below] {Heat Rejection} (1);

% Dots and labels

  \filldraw[blue] (\i) circle (2pt) node[below right] {\label};

\node[left] at (0,1) {$P_1$};
\node[left] at (0,3) {$P_2$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The thermal efficiency of an ideal Brayton cycle is given by:
\[
\eta_{\text{Brayton}} = 1 - \frac{1}{r_p^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}}
\]
Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \eta_{\text{Brayton}} \) is the thermal efficiency
  \item \( r_p = \frac{P_2}{P_1} \) is the pressure ratio
  \item \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} \) is the specific heat ratio
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{\textbf{Turbofan and Turbojet engines:}}

Following the cycle-level analysis, focus was shifted to turbojet and turbofan engine architectures. Turbojet engines direct all intake air through the core, maximizing specific thrust but at the cost of higher fuel consumption. Turbofan engines, especially high-bypass types, offer improved propulsive efficiency by incorporating a fan-driven bypass stream. To evaluate realistic engine behavior, key loss mechanisms such as component inefficiencies, pressure drops, and cooling losses were reviewed based on methodologies presented in \cite{mattingly}. These losses were subsequently incorporated into performance models to reflect non-ideal conditions.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{\textbf{Combustion Fundamentals: Premixed and Diffusion Flames}}

To accurately model combustion behavior in gas turbines, the fundamental characteristics of premixed and diffusion flames were studied. Parameters such as flame speed, temperature, and equivalence ratio were explored for various fuel-air mixtures, particularly with methane–hydrogen blends(for varying equivalence ratios). This theoretical foundation informed the simulation approach adopted later using detailed chemical kinetics. \cite{turns}


\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{\textbf{Hydrogen as a fuel}}
\subsection{Properties of hydrogen}
Hydrogen has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional hydrocarbon fuels in aviation due to its zero carbon emissions, high specific energy, and clean combustion characteristics.The energy density of Hydrogen is the highest(\textbf{120MJ/kg}) (excluding the radioactive elements),with methane or other aviation fuels like Jet-A being around \textbf{50MJ/kg}.The low molecular weight of hydrogen gives it a high specific impulse, allowing \textbf{1kg/s} of hydrogen fuel to provide \textbf{450 kg} of thrust force. As indicated by previous studies, hydrogen has the lowest molecular weight among all elements, necessitating much larger storage tanks to hold the same weight of fuel. When comparing hydrogen fuel to conventional kerosene fuel, the volume of hydrogen required is three times larger to achieve the same energy content\cite{singh2025}. This means that if hydrogen fuels are to be used in existing aircraft, although the weight of the fuel tank could be reduced, the space needed for the fuel tank would be significantly larger compared to conventionally fuelled aircraft.At present, employing solid hydrogen fuel in commercial aircraft is deemed impractical and economically unfeasible. The more viable option is to use hydrogen in its liquid form. However, the storage of liquid fuel presents a complex challenge. For the use of liquid hydrogen, NASA employs vacuum cryogenic tanks to store the fuel at temperatures lower than -423 degrees Fahrenheit\cite{singh2025}. While hydrogen fuel stands as a promising solution for environmental pollution and long-term development, the storage of hydrogen fuel on commercial aircraft remains a significant challenge that must be addressed.
\\
 Low pressure combustion tests have demonstrated that H2 can 
maintain stable combustion at pressure as low as 0.01 bar at an equivalence ratio , compared to 0.043 bar for kerosene \cite{silverstein1955} . This indicates that H2 could offer better performance in altitude relights conditions,owing to its broad flammability limits and low-pressure flame stability.
\\
\\

\subsection{Storage of hydrogen for aviation}
H\textsubscript{2} is mainly found as gas. But using H\textsubscript{2} in gaseous form for aviation is practically and economically infeasible due to the large volume and the excessive weight of the storage tank.Thus, storing hydrogen in its liquid 
state is the most suitable solution for long-endurance aircraft applications. To store hydrogen in a liquid state, high pressure and low temperature are necessary. Hydrogen must be cooled to -253℃ in one atmosphere, or pressurized to 5000 to 10000 psi at room temperature \cite{silverstein1955}. 
\\
\hspace*{5cm}Though the energy content of H\textsubscript{2} is around 2.8 times the energy content for the same weight of fuel,the volume of liquid H\textsubscript{2} will be around 4 times the volume of aviation kerosene.Consequently, hydrogen fuel requires a significantly larger fuel storage space compared to conventional fuels. Traditional wing storage designs would be too heavy for liquid hydrogen tanks, thus new tank layout designs are being considered to accommodate this unique challenge.
\subsection{Combustion characteristics of using hydrogen}
Its combustion primarily produces water vapor, effectively eliminating CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. Moreover, hydrogen exhibits a wide flammability range, high flame speed, and low ignition energy, which make it highly reactive and suitable for lean combustion applications.
\\
\hspace*{5cm}However, these same properties introduce significant practical challenges. The high laminar flame speed and low quenching distance of hydrogen significantly increase the risk of flashback, particularly in premixed combustion systems. Furthermore, high flame temperatures associated with hydrogen combustion can lead to elevated levels of thermal NO\textsubscript{x} formation, raising environmental and regulatory concerns. \cite{afry2022}
\\
\hspace*{5cm}To address these limitations, hydrogen is often blended with methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), a lighter hydrocarbon with lower reactivity, lower flame speed, and more stable flame behavior. Methane acts as a moderating agent, reducing the propensity for flashback and enabling better control over flame characteristics. Furthermore, methane possesses a well-established infrastructure for storage and delivery, making it a practical transitional fuel for hydrogen-based aviation systems.
\\
\hspace*{5cm}The choice of hydrogen–methane blending ratio is therefore critical. While increasing the hydrogen fraction improves combustion efficiency and reduces CO and unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions, it also intensifies NO\textsubscript{x} formation and the risk of instability. This trade-off necessitates a careful optimization of the blend composition, balancing performance, emissions, and operability.
\\
\hspace*{5cm}At high hydrogen fractions, traditional combustor designs may no longer be adequate. To mitigate the risks associated with high reactivity, micromix combustor architectures have been proposed and experimentally validated. These designs distribute fuel and air into multiple mini-jets, enabling rapid mixing and localized combustion zones that significantly suppress NO\textsubscript{x} emissions while avoiding flashback. Micromix combustors offer a promising pathway for safely utilizing high-H\textsubscript{2} blends in aviation gas turbines, especially under premixed operating regimes.\cite{dahl2010}
\\

\subsection{Micromix combustors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concept Overview:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The hydrogen micromix concept is a promising design for gas turbine combustion systems using H$_2$ fuel.
        \item It aims to \textbf{maximize mixing intensity} and \textbf{minimize the mixing scale}, ideally down to the molecular level.
        \item As described by Dahl et al. \cite{dahl2010}, \textit{“Micromix is an attempt to minimize the scale of mixing and to maximize the mixing intensity.”}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Flame Structure and NO$_x$ Emission Control:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Micromix combustors utilize \textbf{many small-scale flames}, as opposed to fewer large flames in conventional designs.
        \item The reduced flame size leads to a \textbf{shorter residence time} of O$_2$ and N$_2$ in the hot zone (typically $<1$ ms), significantly reducing NO$_x$ emissions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Mixing Efficiency Enhancement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uniform H$_2$–air mixing is essential to support \textbf{lean combustion} under all power and operating conditions.
        \item Advanced flow geometries promote thorough mixing, minimizing temperature gradients and hot spots that lead to NO$_x$ formation.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Flashback and Autoignition Prevention:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By maintaining the flow velocity above the \textbf{laminar flame speed} of hydrogen, the risk of flashback and autoignition is reduced.
        \item Proper design ensures that any upstream flame propagation is effectively quenched, enhancing safety.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Micro-Scale Flame Management:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Miniaturization of flame structures prevents \textbf{flame merging or interaction}, which could increase NO$_x$ precursors.
        \item This approach improves combustion stability, maximizes efficiency, and minimizes emissions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

 \\

 \textbf{Aerodynamic flame stabilization} - Aerodynamic flame stabilization is crucial for the efficient operation of micromix combustion systems. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:micromix}, two distinct recirculation zones, referred to as the inner and outer vortices, form downstream of bluff bodies. The air guiding panel (AGP) and the H2 supply segment act as bluff bodies, with their induced blockage defining the size, shape, and intensity of these recirculation zones.

\section{\textbf{Mean-Line Analysis and Turbine Geometry Modeling}}
To complement system-level analysis, mean-line modeling techniques were explored for radial inflow turbines, guided by thesis work shared by the supervisor. This approach enabled estimation of turbine geometry, flow conditions, and work output from basic design parameters. Although kept supplementary to the main thrust modeling, it contributed valuable insight into component-level design sensitivity.

\subsection*{1  Thermodynamic Cycle Modeling using DWSIM}

To develop a fundamental understanding of thermodynamic cycles used in power and propulsion systems, the internship began with the simulation of basic cycles using DWSIM. The focus was on the Otto, Diesel, and Brayton cycles, all modeled under closed-cycle assumptions.
 \cite{naggas}
\textbf{Otto and Diesel Cycles in DWSIM:} These internal combustion engine cycles were simulated using ideal thermodynamic assumptions to analyze how changes in compression ratio, heat input, and expansion processes influence thermal efficiency. The Otto cycle, with constant-volume heat addition, and the Diesel cycle, with constant-pressure heat addition, were compared in terms of efficiency and work output.

\textbf{Closed Brayton Cycle in DWSIM:} The Brayton cycle, representing the thermodynamic basis of gas turbine engines, was also modeled in DWSIM as a closed cycle. The simulation included isentropic compression and expansion stages, as well as constant-pressure heat addition and rejection. However, a more realistic analysis of the open Brayton cycle was carried out later using Python, as part of the detailed performance modeling of turbojet and turbofan engines.
\\
\hspace*{5cm}These preliminary cycle simulations provided foundational insights into thermodynamic behavior, energy conversion efficiency, and the role of key cycle parameters. The knowledge gained from this phase was essential for developing a more realistic open-cycle turbofan engine model later in the project, which incorporated combustion of hydrogen–methane blends and was implemented using Python and Cantera.

\subsection*{2  Performance Modeling of Turbofan Engines}

Before incorporating detailed combustion simulations, simplified engine performance models for both turbojet and turbofan configurations were developed using Python. These models were based on standard thermodynamic relations and assumed ideal and real cycle conditions, allowing for rapid parametric studies.

The analysis included the computation of key performance metrics such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Thrust
  \item Fuel-to-air ratio
  \item Specific fuel consumption (TSFC)
  \item Thermal and propulsive efficiency
\end{itemize}

Parametric sweeps were conducted for both ideal and real engines to evaluate the influence of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compressor pressure ratio (CPR)}
  \item \textbf{Fan pressure ratio (FPR)} 
  \item \textbf{Bypass ratio (BPR)}
  \item \textbf{Flight Mach number}
\end{itemize}

Real engine models included component-level losses such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies
  \item Pressure losses in combustion chamber
  \item Mechanical efficiency
  \item As opposed to ideal cycle,c\textsubscript{p} value of combustor exit gases is different from the inlet gases.
\end{itemize}

This phase of the project provided insights into baseline engine behavior and allowed for validation of the Python-based simulation framework. The results from these idealized models served as a reference for analyzing the impact of alternative fuels and detailed combustion, which was integrated in the later stages of the study.

\subsection*{3  Cantera-Based Combustion Modeling}

To accurately capture the combustion behavior of methane--hydrogen fuel blends, detailed chemical kinetics simulations were performed using the Python-based combustion software \textbf{Cantera}. Two modeling approaches were employed depending on the target parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{one-dimensional, freely propagating premixed flame model} (\texttt{FreeFlame}) was used to evaluate \textit{laminar flame speed}.
    \item A \textbf{zero-dimensional constant-pressure reactor model} was used to compute \textit{adiabatic flame temperature}, \textit{equilibrium species concentrations}, and \textit{ignition delay times}.
\end{itemize}

All simulations were carried out under the assumptions of \textbf{steady-state}, \textbf{adiabatic}, and \textbf{homogeneous} combustion conditions, using the \textbf{GRI-Mech 3.0} reaction mechanism for CH$_4$--H$_2$--air mixtures.\cite{cantera}

\subsubsection*{Simulation Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fuel blend composition:} Hydrogen volume fraction varied from 0\% to 100\% in steps of 25\%
    \item \textbf{Equivalence ratio ($\phi$):} Ranged from 0 to 2.0, covering lean to rich regimes
    \item \textbf{Initial pressure:} Set to 1 atm for most cases, with select simulations at elevated pressures
    \item \textbf{Initial temperature:} Standard value of 298~K used as the unburned gas temperature
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Output Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Laminar flame speed (from 1D \texttt{FreeFlame} simulations)
    \item Adiabatic flame temperature (from 0D equilibrium simulations)
    \item Mole fractions of major species: CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, NO
    \item Species concentration variation with combustion zone thickness
\end{itemize}

These simulations enabled a detailed investigation of how \textbf{hydrogen enrichment} affects flame propagation, thermal behavior, emissions, and reactivity. The results obtained from this section were later integrated into the \textbf{turbofan engine cycle analysis} to assess the impact of fuel blending on overall engine performance and emissions.

\subsection*{4  Turbofan Engine Simulation with Fuel Integration}

In the final phase of the project, a comprehensive turbofan engine model was developed in Python to simulate the full engine cycle with integrated combustion data obtained from Cantera.\cite{cantera} The model accounted for all major components including inlet, fan, compressor, combustor, turbine, and nozzle.

The combustion chamber was assumed to be micromix combustor and the pressure difference was computed accordingly. The fuel–air mixture was defined based on the selected hydrogen–methane blend and equivalence ratio ($\phi$) for the fixed turbine inlet temperature(2100K). The adiabatic flame temperature(TIT) and product composition were imported from precomputed Cantera simulations and used as inputs to the burner component.

The model supported real engine assumptions, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Component efficiencies (compressor, fan, turbine)
  \item Pressure losses in the combustor
  \item Variable turbine inlet temperature (TIT) based on combustion results
  \item Real gas properties using temperature-dependent $c_p$ values
\end{itemize}

For each simulation run, the following parameters were computed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Net thrust
  \item Fuel-to-air ratio (FAR)
  \item Specific thrust
  \item Thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC)
  \item Thermal and propulsive efficiency
  \item NO\textsubscript{x} emissions
\end{itemize}

Parametric studies were conducted for a range of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hydrogen volume fractions in the fuel (0\% to 100\%)
  \item Equivalence ratios from lean to rich conditions
  \item Fan and compressor pressure ratios
  \item Bypass ratios and flight Mach numbers
\end{itemize}

This integrated modeling approach enabled a realistic assessment of how alternative fuel blends impact overall engine performance and emissions. It also provided a platform to analyze trade-offs between efficiency, thrust, and environmental impact.
\\
\subsection*{5  Radial Inflow Turbine Modeling}

The performance analysis of the radial inflow turbine (RIT) was carried out using a mean-line modeling approach, as described in the reference thesis provided by the supervising faculty. This method provides a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for preliminary design and performance assessment.

\subsection*{5.1  Assumptions and Thermodynamic Framework}

The following assumptions were made to simplify the turbine analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The flow is steady, adiabatic, and compressible.
    \item Ideal gas behavior is assumed with constant specific heats.
    \item All the parameters specified are given in the results part.
    \item Isentropic efficiency ($\eta_t$) is used to account for losses.
    \item The real life loss functions observed are: incidence loss,rotor passage loss,tip clearance loss,exit energy loss,nozzle passage loss and trailing edge loss.
    
\end{itemize}

To assess the performance of the radial inflow turbine, a detailed mean-line loss model was implemented using Python. The methodology involved computing individual loss components — including incidence loss, rotor passage loss, tip clearance loss, exit kinetic energy loss, nozzle passage loss, and trailing edge loss — using empirical relations from Table 3.2 of the reference thesis. Input parameters such as blade angles, flow velocities, geometric dimensions, and Reynolds number were used to evaluate these losses for a given turbine configuration.

In addition to loss analysis, the isentropic efficiency of the turbine was analyzed across a range of operating conditions. Parametric studies were performed by varying key design variables including blade speed, meridional velocity, pitch-to-chord ratio, and mass flow rate. Python scripts were used to calculate and visualize the resulting trends. Matplotlib was employed to generate plots of isentropic efficiency versus each parameter, which helped in understanding the sensitivity of turbine performance to these variables and identifying optimal operating regimes.
\subsection*{5.2  Implementation}

All equations and plots were implemented using Python and Matplotlib. Plots generated include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Individual loss components
    \item isentropic efficiency vs specific speed
    \item isentropic efficiency vs pitch to chord ratio
    \item isentropic efficiency vs blade angle
    \item isentropic efficiency vs meridonial velocity
\end{itemize}

This modeling framework enables preliminary evaluation of RIT performance for integration into compact propulsion systems or hybrid-electric configurations.

\subsection*{1)Thermodynamic analysis of turbofan engines with varying parameters}

A ideal turbofan engine is selected, with the following characteristics \cite{mattingly}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No real losses are taken into account.
    \item No pressure losses in combustion.
    \item Turbine inlet temperature(TIT)=1950K
    \item The specific heat ratio of air is assumed to be same throughout and it doesn't change with temperature.
\end{itemize}
\\
\\
The parameters varied include compressor pressure ratio (CPR), fan pressure ratio (FPR), flight Mach number, and bypass ratio (BPR).
\\
\\
\subsubsection*{1.1) Performance metrics of the engine with varying compressor ratio and bypass ratio(8.5, 9.6 and 10) }

 The results are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ideal_compressor}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{ideal_compressor.png}
    \caption{Variation of parameters vs compressor pressure ratio for an ideal turbofan engine}
    \label{fig:ideal_compressor}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Specific Thrust}
As seen in  Figure~\ref{fig:ideal_compressor}, the specific thrust initially increases with CPR, reaches a peak around CPR = 30–35, and then begins to decline slightly. This is because the increased compression initially boosts the energy available for thrust production, but diminishing returns and rising exhaust velocity eventually reduce the net gain. Higher bypass ratios consistently produce lower specific thrust due to the larger proportion of bypassed air and reduced core contribution.

\subsection*{Fuel-to-Air Ratio}
The fuel-to-air ratio decreases with increasing CPR. Higher CPR leads to a higher temperature at the end of compression, requiring less fuel to reach the desired turbine inlet temperature. The trends are nearly identical for all bypass ratios, as FAR is governed primarily by the core thermodynamics in the ideal cycle.

\subsection*{Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC)}
The plot shows that TSFC decreases with increasing CPR, indicating improved fuel efficiency. This is due to the increased thermal efficiency of the cycle at higher compression levels. Additionally, higher bypass ratios consistently yield lower TSFC values, reflecting their improved propulsive performance and reduced core fuel usage.

\subsection*{Thermal Efficiency}
Thermal efficiency is seen to increase monotonically with CPR, which aligns with Brayton cycle theory. Since thermal efficiency is governed by the pressure ratio of the core, the effect of bypass ratio on this metric is negligible in the ideal case.

\subsection*{Propulsive Efficiency}
Propulsive efficiency shows a slight U-shaped trend with CPR. Initially, it decreases slightly due to mismatch in exhaust jet speed and flight speed but recovers at higher CPRs. Bypass ratio has a significant effect here — higher BPR results in higher propulsive efficiency, due to lower exhaust velocities closer to the aircraft’s flight speed.

\subsection*{Overall Efficiency}
The overall efficiency increases with CPR, with the highest values corresponding to the largest bypass ratio (BR = 10.0). This is due to the combined effect of increasing thermal and propulsive efficiency. Higher bypass ratios result in better overall performance, confirming the advantage of high-BPR configurations in subsonic civil turbofans.

\subsection*{Summary}
The results indicate that increasing compressor pressure ratio improves overall performance up to a point, beyond which benefits diminish. High bypass ratios improve propulsive and overall efficiency but reduce specific thrust. Therefore, bypass ratio acts as a trade-off parameter between thrust output and fuel efficiency, with BR = 9.6–10.0 yielding the best balance under ideal conditions.
\\
\\
\subsubsection*{1.2) Effect of Fan Pressure Ratio and Mach Number on Turbofan Performance}

 The results are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ideal}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{ideal.png}
    \caption{Variation of parameters vs mach number and fan pressure ratio for an ideal turbofan engine}
    \label{fig:ideal}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Specific Thrust}
Specific thrust decreases with increasing Mach number due to rising freestream velocity, which reduces net momentum change. Higher FPR results in higher specific thrust at all speeds due to greater bypass flow acceleration.

\subsubsection*{Fuel-to-Air Ratio}
Fuel-to-air ratio slightly decreases with Mach number, as the inlet temperature increases from ram compression. All FPR cases show similar behavior.

\subsubsection*{Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC)}
TSFC increases with Mach number, primarily due to the drop in specific thrust. Higher FPR results in lower TSFC, reflecting improved bypass-driven fuel economy.

\subsubsection*{Thermal Efficiency}
Thermal efficiency improves marginally with Mach number due to increased ram recovery. FPR has minimal influence on this parameter in ideal analysis.

\subsubsection*{Propulsive Efficiency}
Propulsive efficiency increases sharply at low Mach numbers and gradually saturates. Higher FPR yields better propulsive efficiency by producing lower exhaust velocities.

\subsubsection*{Overall Efficiency}
Overall efficiency increases with Mach number, following the propulsive trend. Higher FPR (2.0–2.3) results in maximum overall efficiency, suggesting an optimal fan pressure ratio range for subsonic cruise conditions.

\subsubsection*{Summary}
Mach number plays a critical role in improving propulsive and overall efficiency. Fan pressure ratio significantly affects bypass thrust and fuel economy, with values in the range 1.7 to 2.3 being optimal in ideal subsonic conditions.

\subsection*{2)Comparison Between Real and Ideal Engine Performance}

\textbf{Note on Thermodynamic Simplification:} 
In this analysis, the variation of specific heat capacities with temperature is not explicitly accounted for; instead, average or constant values are assumed across engine components. In real engines, specific heat varies notably with temperature, especially across high-temperature regions like the turbine and combustor. This simplification may slightly affect the accuracy of calculated parameters such as specific thrust, thermal efficiency, and TSFC. However, it is a common assumption in preliminary engine cycle studies and does not significantly impact the overall trend comparisons between ideal and real cycles.
\\
\\
\\

For this comparison, the \textbf{Rolls-Royce Trent XWB} high-bypass turbofan engine is selected as the reference model. This engine is widely used in commercial long-haul aircraft (notably the Airbus A350) and is recognized for its advanced technology, high thermal efficiency, and environmental performance. Its design parameters and publicly available data make it a suitable candidate for academic and simulation-based studies. \cite{rrtrent}

The turbine inlet temperature is fixed at \textbf{1800~K}, which is representative of modern high-performance engines. The performance comparison is carried out at a \textbf{cruise Mach number of 0.85}, corresponding to an altitude of approximately \textbf{11~km}. At this altitude, the \textbf{ambient temperature} is taken as \textbf{216.65~K}, and the \textbf{ambient pressure} is set to \textbf{22,595.5~Pa}, in accordance with the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).\cite{isa}
\\
For the real engine simulation, the following component efficiencies are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compressor efficiency: $\eta_c = 0.91$
    \item Turbine efficiency: $\eta_t = 0.89$
    \item Combustor efficiency: $\eta_b = 0.98$
    \item Fan efficiency: $\eta_f = 0.92$
    \item Mechanical efficiency: $\eta_m = 1$
\end{itemize}

Other engine design parameters include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bypass ratio: $\beta = 9.6$
    \item Compressor pressure ratio: $\pi_c = 50$
    \item Combustor pressure loss coefficient: $\pi_b = 0.96$
\end{itemize}

In the \textbf{ideal engine model}, the real-world inefficiencies are ignored; all components are assumed to operate isentropically, and pressure or heat losses are neglected.

The plots presented below compare the variation of key performance parameters such as \textbf{specific thrust}, \textbf{fuel-to-air ratio}, \textbf{thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC)}, and \textbf{thermal, propulsive and overall efficiency} for real and ideal cycles under varying fan pressure ratios, bypass ratios, mach number and compressor pressure ratios. These comparisons provide insights into the effects of component efficiencies and practical losses on overall engine performance.

\end{figure}
\\
\subsection*{2.1) Variation of Performance Parameters with Compressor Pressure Ratio}

Figure~\ref{fig:compressor_pressure_ratio} shows the variation of key performance parameters with compressor pressure ratio ($\pi_c$) for both \textbf{ideal} and \textbf{real} turbojet cycles. The ideal cycle assumes isentropic compression and expansion without any pressure or efficiency losses, whereas the real cycle includes realistic component efficiencies (compressor and turbine) and pressure losses in the combustor.

\textbf{Specific Thrust:} The specific thrust initially increases with $\pi_c$, reaches a maximum around $\pi_c \approx 20$--$30$, and then gradually declines. This is because increased compression initially enhances the exhaust jet velocity, but eventually, the increase in compressor work and limited turbine inlet temperature (TIT) reduce the available net work. The real cycle produces lower specific thrust than the ideal case due to non-idealities in compression, combustion, and expansion.

\textbf{Fuel-to-Air Ratio:} The fuel-to-air ratio decreases with increasing $\pi_c$, since a higher compressor exit temperature reduces the additional fuel needed to reach the fixed TIT. However, the real engine consumes more fuel than the ideal case to overcome pressure and efficiency losses in the cycle.

\textbf{Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC):} TSFC decreases significantly with increasing $\pi_c$ due to the combined effects of increasing specific thrust and decreasing fuel consumption. The TSFC for the real engine is higher than that of the ideal case throughout, reflecting greater fuel consumption per unit thrust due to inefficiencies.

\textbf{Thermal Efficiency:} Thermal efficiency increases with compressor pressure ratio, following Brayton cycle theory. As $\pi_c$ increases, the average temperature at which heat is added increases, improving the cycle efficiency. The ideal cycle achieves higher thermal efficiency (more than $\sim 74\%$), while the real cycle is limited to around $50\%$ due to irreversibilities and pressure losses.

\textbf{Propulsive Efficiency:} Propulsive efficiency is notably higher in the real engine, especially at high bypass ratios. Modern turbofans are designed to accelerate a large mass of air at lower velocity, making the jet speed closer to aircraft speed and maximizing propulsive efficiency—something not fully captured in ideal cycle models
\\
\\
\textbf{Overall Efficiency:} The overall efficiency, which is the product of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, increases with $\pi_c$ but begins to plateau around $\pi_c \approx 40$. The ideal cycle achieves a maximum overall efficiency of approximately $48\%$, whereas the real cycle reaches about $34\%$. The gap highlights the impact of real-world losses.



\subsubsection*{Key Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The optimum $\pi_c$ for maximum specific thrust is approximately $20$--$30$.
    \item TSFC continues to improve until $\pi_c \approx 45$, beyond which gains become marginal.
    \item There is limited benefit in increasing $\pi_c$ beyond 45 due to diminishing overall efficiency and higher compressor exit temperatures.
    \item Real cycle efficiency is consistently lower due to losses in compressor, turbine, and combustion components.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:fan_pressure_ratio}
\end{figure}
\\
\subsection*{2.2) Variation of Performance Parameters with Fan Pressure Ratio}
Figure~\ref{fig:fan_pressure_ratio} shows the variation of key performance parameters with fan pressure ratio ($\pi_f$) for both \textbf{ideal} and \textbf{real} turbojet cycles.
\\
\\
\textbf{Specific Thrust:} For both ideal and real cases, specific thrust increases with fan pressure ratio (FPR), peaks, and then declines. In the real cycle, the peak occurs at a lower FPR than in the ideal case, due to losses in compression, expansion, and combustion processes, which cause the engine to reach its performance limit earlier.
\\
\\
\textbf{Fuel to air ratio:}The fuel-to-air ratio remains nearly constant with varying fan pressure ratio (FPR) for both the ideal and real cycles. However, it is significantly higher in the real engine compared to the ideal cycle in order to achieve the same turbine inlet temperature (TIT). This is because real engines experience pressure losses in the intake and combustor, as well as non-ideal component efficiencies, which require additional fuel input to compensate for the reduced thermal efficiency and maintain the desired TIT.
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{TSFC:}TSFC decreases with increasing $\pi_f$ ,peaks and then increases due to the combined effects of behaviour of specific thrust and constant fuel consumption. The TSFC for the real engine is higher than that of the ideal case throughout, reflecting greater fuel consumption per unit thrust due to inefficiencies.
\\
\\
\textbf{Thermal Efficiency:}In the ideal cycle, thermal efficiency remains constant with increasing fan pressure ratio (FPR) because the fan does not affect the core Brayton cycle. However, in the real cycle, thermal efficiency decreases with FPR due to increased fan work demand, which requires more turbine work. This reduces the energy available for useful expansion in the core, and combined with additional pressure and efficiency losses, lowers the overall thermal efficiency.
\\
\\
\textbf{Propulsive Efficiency:}Propulsive efficiency increases with fan pressure ratio (FPR) in both ideal and real cycles. A higher FPR leads to a lower jet velocity for the same thrust, which reduces kinetic energy losses in the exhaust and improves propulsion effectiveness. In real engines, this trend is slightly dampened by fan and nozzle losses, but the overall increase with FPR still holds.
\\
\\
\textbf{Overall Efficiency:}Overall efficiency, being the product of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, initially increases with FPR due to the rise in propulsive efficiency. However, in the real cycle, it eventually saturates or slightly decreases at high FPRs as thermal efficiency drops due to increased turbine load and system losses. Thus, there is an optimal FPR range where overall efficiency is maximized.

\\
\subsection*{2.3) Variation of Performance Parameters with mach number}
Figure~\ref{fig:mach_number} shows the variation of key performance parameters with mach number(in the subsonic range) for both \textbf{ideal} and \textbf{real} turbojet cycles.
\\
\\
\textbf{Specific Thrust:} Specific thrust typically decreases with increasing Mach number due to reduced pressure ratio across the engine.In ideal cycles, the drop is less steep as no losses are considered. In real cycles, the reduction is more pronounced due to pressure and thermal losses in the intake and nozzle.
\\
\\
\textbf{Fuel to air ratio:}The rate of decrease of fuel to air ratio with mach number is low, Fuel to air ratio is higher in real cycles due to the need to compensate for efficiency losses in compressors and turbines.
\\
\\
\textbf{TSFC:}TSFC increases with increasing mach number due to rapid decrease in the value of specific thrust and a low rate of decrease in fuel to air ratio. The TSFC for the real engine is higher than that of the ideal case throughout, reflecting greater fuel consumption per unit thrust due to inefficiencies.
\\
\\
\textbf{Thermal Efficiency:}In the ideal cycle, thermal efficiency slightly increases with Mach number due to improved ram compression and higher overall pressure ratio at the combustor.
In contrast, the real cycle shows a decline in thermal efficiency at higher Mach due to growing losses in the inlet and compressor, reducing the effective temperature rise across the cycle.
\\
\\
\textbf{Propulsive Efficiency:}Propulsive efficiency increases with Mach number in both ideal and real cycles. The real cycle shows higher propulsive efficiency due to a lower exhaust jet velocity, which reduces kinetic energy losses. In contrast, the ideal cycle produces a higher jet velocity, leading to increased mismatch with flight speed and lower efficiency.
\\
\\
\textbf{Overall Efficiency:}Overall efficiency, being the product of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, increases with mach number.The overall efficiency for ideal cycle is higher than the real cycle and the difference increases with increasing mach number.

\textbf{This section offers valuable insights into the deviations between ideal and real thermodynamic cycles, highlighting how real-world losses—such as pressure drops, component inefficiencies, and non-isentropic processes—affect engine performance. It underscores the limitations of idealized assumptions and emphasizes the importance of incorporating practical considerations for accurate cycle analysis.}

\subsection*{3)Combustion flame analysis}
Before analyzing the simulation results, it is important to understand the behavior of laminar premixed flames, which form the basis of this study. In a laminar premixed flame, the fuel and oxidizer are mixed homogeneously before ignition, and the flame propagates smoothly through the unburned mixture. These flames are fundamental to combustion science, as they allow direct evaluation of key properties like adiabatic flame temperature, laminar flame speed, and emissions under well-controlled conditions.\cite{turns}
\\
\\
This section focuses on the combustion characteristics of methane–hydrogen fuel blends using simulations performed in Cantera \cite{cantera}, an open-source chemical kinetics and thermodynamics toolkit. The aim is to investigate how key combustion parameters vary with equivalence ratio ($\phi$) and hydrogen blending percentage, both of which critically influence flame behavior, emissions, and overall engine performance.
\\
\\
To study adiabatic flame temperature and NO\textsubscript{x}\ emissions, zero-dimensional constant-pressure reactors were used. These simulate homogeneous, well-mixed combustion under idealized conditions, allowing the evaluation of equilibrium product composition and thermal behavior across a range of $\phi$ and H\textsubscript{2}\ blending ratios.
\\
\\
For the analysis of laminar flame speed, a one-dimensional premixed flame model (FreeFlame in Cantera) was employed. This model resolves the temperature and species profiles across the flame front and computes the flame propagation speed, which is a crucial indicator of fuel reactivity and flame stability in practical combustor designs.
\\
\\
This section builds a foundational understanding of how hydrogen addition affects flame temperature, burning velocity, and NO\textsubscript{x}\  formation—essential for designing cleaner and more efficient hydrogen-enriched propulsion systems.
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{All simulations were performed at standard conditions of 298 K and 1 atm, assuming a homogeneous, laminar, premixed mixture of CH\textsubscript{4}\ - H\textsubscript{2}\ and air. These conditions are commonly used in fundamental combustion studies to evaluate flame properties under controlled environments.}

\end{figure}
\subsection*{3.1) Variation of adiabatic flame temperature vs equivalence ratio}

According to Figure~\ref{fig:adiabatic_flame} ,the adiabatic flame temperature increases with equivalence ratio ($\phi$) for both methane and hydrogen, reaches a peak, and then decreases. For methane, the peak occurs at $\phi$ \approx 1.05$, with a flame temperature of approximately 2225 K. For hydrogen, the peak is observed at $\phi$ \approx 1.07$, with a flame temperature of around 2410 K.At all equivalence ratios, hydrogen–air combustion produces a higher flame temperature than methane–air, while blended fuels exhibit intermediate temperatures depending on the proportion of hydrogen.
\\

\end{figure}
\subsection*{3.2) Variation of laminar flame speed vs equivalence ratio}

According to Figure~\ref{fig:flame speed} ,the laminar flame speed increases with equivalence ratio ($\phi$) for both methane and hydrogen, reaches a peak, and then decreases.For methane, the peak occurs at $\phi$ \approx 1.08$, with a flame speed of approximately 0.38-0.42. For hydrogen, the peak is observed at $\phi$ \approx 1.8$, with a flame speed of around 2.8-3 .At all equivalence ratios, hydrogen–air combustion produces a higher flame temperature than methane–air, while blended fuels exhibit intermediate temperatures depending on the proportion of hydrogen.
\\
\\
For hydrogen–air flames, the adiabatic flame temperature peaks at an equivalence ratio of  $\phi$ \approx 1.07$, while the laminar flame speed reaches its maximum at $\phi$ \approx 1.8$. This significant difference arises due to the effect of the \textbf{Lewis number (Le)}, which is the ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity. Hydrogen has a very low Lewis number (Le < 1), meaning it diffuses faster than heat. This enhanced mass diffusion at rich conditions promotes flame propagation even when the mixture is fuel-rich, causing the flame speed to peak well beyond the point of maximum flame temperature.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{mole_fraction.png}
    \caption{Comparison of NO mole fraction vs equivalence ratio for different fuel blends}
    \label{fig:mole fraction}
\end{figure}
\subsection*{3.3) Variation of NO vs equivalence ratio}
 Most of the nitrogen oxides formed during combustion are in the form of NO; however, subsequently the NO oxidizes to NO\textsubscript{2}\ . Usually these are lumped together, and the
 result is expressed in terms of oxides of nitrogen NO\textsubscript{x}\ .The NO\textsubscript{x}\ formation increases with equivalence ratio,peaks and then decreases.With increase in H2 blend it increases.This is because as the hydrogen blend in the fuel increases,the flame temperature increases.And with increasing flame temperature thermal NO formation increases(\textbf{Zeldovich mechanism}). \textbf{Thermal NO formation} is, for the hydrogen combustion, the most contributing mechanism to the total NO formation. Thermal NO is produced from the nitrogen and oxygen present in the air in the high temperature regions of the flame and in the postflame gases. The process is endothermic and proceeds at a considerable rate, only at temperatures above around 1850 K.
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{Prompt NO} is a designation for NO, which, under certain conditions, is formed very early in the flame region. Its initiation reaction includes the carbon atom. Prompt NO may play a significant role for lean systems burning kerosene or methane, whereas it does not contribute to the NO formation in combustion systems using hydrogen since there are no carbon atoms present in the fuel.
\\
\\
\textbf{Fuel NO} is not relevant here, since neither methane nor hydrogen
 fuel contain any nitrogen.

\end{figure}
\\
\\
\subsection*{3.4) Variation of H\textsubscript{2}O vs equivalence ratio}
\\
 When burning hydrogen, the emissions are reduced to water
 vapor H\textsubscript{2}O and oxides of nitrogen NO\textsubscript{x}. In fact, the emission
 index of H\textsubscript{2}O increases by a factor of 2.6.As the equivalence ratio increases, the mole fraction of H\textsubscript{2}O rises due to the greater availability of hydrogen atoms from the fuel, particularly in hydrogen-rich blends. Since H\textsubscript{2}O is a major combustion product formed by the oxidation of hydrogen, richer mixtures with higher $\phi$ result in enhanced H\textsubscript{2}O formation, especially when oxygen is still sufficient for near-complete combustion.This trait is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:h20}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{co2.png}

\end{figure}
\vspace{5cm}
\subsection*{3.5) Variation of CO\textsubscript{2} vs equivalence ratio}

The mole fraction of CO\textsubscript{2} increases with equivalence ratio ($\phi$), reaches a peak near stoichiometric conditions ($\phi \approx 1.0$), and then decreases for richer mixtures across all H\textsubscript{2}--CH\textsubscript{4} blends. This behavior can be attributed to the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Under \textbf{stoichiometric conditions}, complete combustion of methane leads to maximum CO\textsubscript{2} production.
    \item In \textbf{lean mixtures} ($\phi < 1$), oxygen is in excess but fuel is limited, leading to incomplete carbon utilization.
    \item In \textbf{rich mixtures} ($\phi > 1$), oxygen becomes limiting, and carbon is only partially oxidized, favoring CO over CO\textsubscript{2}.
\end{itemize}

As the hydrogen content in the fuel increases, the overall CO\textsubscript{2} formation decreases since hydrogen does not contribute any carbon. For pure hydrogen (100\% H\textsubscript{2}), no CO\textsubscript{2} is produced, which is reflected by the flat zero line on the graph.

\subsection*{3.5) Species Profiles Across a CH\textsubscript{4}–Air Premixed Flame ($\phi = 1.0$)}

Figure~\ref{fig:species} shows the spatial variation of major species mole fractions across a one-dimensional, freely propagating laminar premixed CH\textsubscript{4}–air flame at stoichiometric conditions ($\phi = 1.0$):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CH\textsubscript{4}} and \textbf{O\textsubscript{2}} are the primary reactants, and their mole fractions decrease sharply across the flame front as combustion proceeds.After the reaction zone the mole fraction of CH\textsubscript{4} becomes 0,while that's not the case with O\textsubscript{2}.
    \item The reaction zone is located near $x \approx 0.02$~m, characterized by steep gradients in species concentrations due to intense chemical activity.
    \item \textbf{H\textsubscript{2}O} and \textbf{CO\textsubscript{2}}, the main combustion products, increase rapidly within the flame zone and stabilize downstream.
    \item \textbf{CO} and \textbf{OH} are key intermediate species, peaking within the flame front and decreasing afterward as they are converted into final products.
    \item The higher peak in H\textsubscript{2}O compared to CO\textsubscript{2} reflects the high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio in methane.
    \item The presence of OH radicals indicates active chain-branching reactions and strong heat release within the flame.
\end{itemize}

This profile highlights the thin, well-defined reaction zone and the distinct separation between reactants, intermediates, and products, characteristic of laminar premixed flames.

\subsection*{Flame Temperature–NO\textsubscript{x} Trade-off and Its Impact on TIT Selection}


The adiabatic flame temperature increases with rising equivalence ratio in the lean region for all H\textsubscript{2}-CH\textsubscript{4} blends. As per the Zeldovich mechanism, thermal NO\textsubscript{x} formation becomes significant above \textbf{1850~K} and rises rapidly beyond \textbf{2200~K}.

For the Trent XWB engine model, although the actual turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is around \textbf{1950~K}, it was increased to \textbf{2100~K} during simulations. At lower TITs (1950–2000~K), the calculated fuel mass flow rate turned negative for some blends at the given air flow rate (150~m/s), indicating insufficient energy release. The chosen TIT of 2100~K ensures a valid fuel flow while keeping NO\textsubscript{x} formation within acceptable limits.


\newpage
\subsection*{4)Turbofan engine cycle analysis with H\textsubscript{2}-CH\textsubscript{4} blends}
A Python-based turbofan engine simulation was developed to evaluate the impact of hydrogen enrichment on engine performance and emissions. The model incorporated realistic thermodynamic losses, such as component isentropic efficiencies and turbine inlet temperature constraints (TIT = 2100~K). Different fuel blends of CH\textsubscript{4}–H\textsubscript{2} were analyzed under both static and flight conditions (V = 0 and 255~m/s), for varying equivalence ratios and air mass flow rates. Key output metrics included specific thrust, turbine power, thermal and propulsive efficiencies, and pollutant formation (NO\textsubscript{x} and CO\textsubscript{2}).
\\
\\
To achieve the desired Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT), the adiabatic flame temperature of each fuel blend is taken into account. Based on the plotted graphs, the corresponding equivalence ratios for different blends are determined accordingly.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0\% H\textsubscript{2}:    0.374
    \item 25\% H\textsubscript{2}:   0.366
    \item 50\% H\textsubscript{2}:   0.36
    \item 75\% H\textsubscript{2}:   0.34
    \item 100\% H\textsubscript{2}:  0.31
\end{itemize}

The mass flow rate of CH\textsubscript{4} (\textbf{3.27 kg/s}) decreases with increase in the H\textsubscript{2}\% in the fuel,with 100\% H\textsubscript{2} being (\textbf{1.36 kg/s}).The trend observed in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:bfuel}} can be attributed to the higher lower heating value (LHV) of hydrogen compared to methane. Hydrogen releases more energy per unit mass, thereby requiring a smaller fuel mass flow to reach the same turbine inlet temperature. Moreover, hydrogen's faster reaction kinetics and higher adiabatic flame temperature improve combustion efficiency, further reducing the quantity needed.

Overall, the use of hydrogen-rich blends offers clear thermodynamic benefits by reducing the fuel consumption required to achieve a given TIT, which can also positively impact engine weight, efficiency, and emissions.

\\
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:bthrust}} shows that specific thrust over the blend range doesn't change signigicantly.It increases with increasing hydrogen ratio in the blend very less,which is not captured in the graph.For pure H\textsubscript{2},it is \textbf{323.16 N.s/kg} and for pure CH\textsubscript{4},it is \textbf{322.65 N.s/kg}
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:btsfc}} shows a decreasing trend over increase in hydrogen ratio in the fuel.This is because specific thrust remains almost same and fuel consumed decreases with increasing H\textsubscript{2} ratio in the fuel.
\\

\\

\textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:bturbine}} shows a nearly constant turbine power.This near-constant behavior can be explained by the fact that the turbine inlet temperature is held fixed at 2100 K for all cases. Since turbine power primarily depends on the enthalpy drop across the turbine and the mass flow a

Turbojet engines play a crucial role in air transportation, providing superior thrust-to-weight ratios and lower NOx emissions compared to gas turbine engines, particularly at high speeds. Although they are efficient, environmental concerns and rising fuel costs have led to the exploration of alternative fuels.
This research internship focused on the simulation and thermodynamic analysis of various power cycles and the performance modeling of a modern turbofan engine using different blends of CH\textsubscript{4} and H\textsubscript{2}.
Initially, classical thermodynamic cycles — including Brayton, Otto, and Diesel — were modeled and analyzed using DWSIM to build foundational understanding of cycle behavior.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip} % Use vspace with a multiple of baselineskip for consistent vertical spacing
The second phase of the project involved developing a Python-based simulation of a turbofan engine operating on methane, hydrogen, and their blends. The model incorporated detailed combustion calculations using Cantera to account for variations in flame temperature, equivalence ratio, and fuel composition. Key performance metrics such as specific thrust, thermal efficiency, turbine work, and emissions were evaluated. The study highlights how fuel composition and operating parameters impact engine performance, aiming to provide insights for low-emission, high-efficiency propulsion systems using hydrogen-methane based fuel.

The third and the final phase mainly focused on mean line modelling of radial inflow turbine, mainly focusing on the real life losses encountered.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1) Modeling of Turbofan Engines Using Hydrogen-Methane Blends for Sustainable Aviation}

The aviation industry is heavily reliant on gas turbine propulsion systems, with turbofan engines being the most commonly used configuration in commercial and military aircraft. Their high bypass ratio, fuel efficiency, and ability to deliver large amounts of thrust make them ideal for long-range, high-subsonic flight. Over the years, improvements in turbofan design have led to better performance and noise reduction, helping meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
Despite these advances, the environmental footprint of aviation remains a major global concern. Conventional aviation fuels, derived from fossil sources, contribute significantly to carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) emissions, and NO\textsubscript{x} emissions from high-temperature combustion can lead to ozone formation and other atmospheric effects. In light of these challenges, there is growing interest in the adoption of alternative fuels, especially hydrogen, because of their potential for zero-carbon combustion and high specific energy content.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
However, transitioning to hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuels introduces new complexities. These include issues related to combustion stability, flame speed, NO\textsubscript{x} formation, fuel storage, and delivery. One promising near-term approach is the use of hydrogen-methane fuel blends, which can combine the cleaner combustion characteristics of hydrogen with the stable and well-understood behavior of methane.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
This project focuses on evaluating the performance of a turbofan engine operating with various blends of hydrogen and methane. The study integrates thermodynamic cycle modeling with chemical kinetics-based combustion analysis using Cantera, an open-source simulation platform. The engine model includes key components such as the compressor, combustion chamber, turbines, and nozzle, with a detailed analysis of how the fuel composition and equivalence ratio ($\phi$) influence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Thrust generation
    \item Specific fuel consumption
    \item Thermal and propulsive efficiencies
    \item Exhaust temperature and emission trends (e.g., NO\textsubscript{x} formation)
\end{itemize}

The goal is to assess the feasibility of using hydrogen-rich fuels in aviation gas turbines and to identify optimal operating conditions that balance performance and emissions. This work supports ongoing research efforts in the field of sustainable aviation propulsion systems, and contributes to the broader vision of achieving low-emission or carbon-neutral air travel in the near future.

\section*{2) Radial Inflow Turbines in Compact Gas Turbine Applications}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{2) Radial Inflow Turbines in Compact Gas Turbine Applications}

In parallel with the study of hydrogen-fueled turbofan engines, a supplementary component of this internship involved the analytical modeling of radial inflow turbines (RITs). These turbines are widely employed in small-scale and micro gas turbine engines, turbochargers, and auxiliary power units due to their compact geometry, ease of manufacturing, and high power-to-weight ratio.

Unlike axial turbines, radial inflow turbines redirect flow from a radial to an axial direction, enabling high expansion ratios within a single stage. Their ability to accommodate large enthalpy drops makes them especially suitable for compact engine architectures and distributed propulsion systems — areas of growing interest in sustainable aviation.

The literature indicates that radial turbines exhibit strong performance at lower mass flow rates and rotational speeds, which are common in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hybrid-electric propulsion systems, and micro gas turbines. Key design parameters affecting RIT performance include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Turbine pressure ratio
    \item Rotor inlet and exit velocity triangles
    \item Blade speed ratio and relative Mach number
    \item Isentropic efficiency
\end{itemize}

As part of this project, mean-line modeling techniques were used to analyze radial turbine behavior over a range of pressure ratios. This included computing thermodynamic work output, generating efficiency curves against blade speed ratio, and plotting velocity triangles — based on methodologies outlined in Section 3.1 of a reference thesis provided by the supervising faculty. These insights contribute to the understanding of small-scale turbine performance and serve as a foundation for future work involving integrated cycle designs or CFD-based optimization.

\cite{naggas}
The Brayton cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic cycle for gas turbine engines. It comprises four main processes: isentropic compression, constant pressure heat addition, isentropic expansion, and constant pressure heat rejection. It is widely used in the propulsion systems of turbofan and turbojet engines as well as stationary gas turbines. Though in the case of turbojet and turbofan engines, it is portrayed as an open Brayton cycle. The schematic diagram is as shown below:

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Turbofan and Turbojet engines}

Following the cycle-level analysis, focus was shifted to turbojet and turbofan engine architectures. Turbojet engines direct all intake air through the core, maximizing specific thrust but at the cost of higher fuel consumption. Turbofan engines, especially high-bypass types, offer improved propulsive efficiency by incorporating a fan-driven bypass stream. To evaluate realistic engine behavior, key loss mechanisms such as component inefficiencies, pressure drops, and cooling losses were reviewed based on methodologies presented in \cite{mattingly}. These losses were subsequently incorporated into performance models to reflect non-ideal conditions.

To accurately model combustion behavior in gas turbines, the fundamental characteristics of premixed and diffusion flames were studied. Parameters such as flame speed, temperature, and equivalence ratio were explored for various fuel-air mixtures, particularly with methane–hydrogen blends (for varying equivalence ratios). This theoretical foundation informed the simulation approach adopted later using detailed chemical kinetics. \cite{turns}

\section{\textbf{Hydrogen as a fuel}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Hydrogen as a fuel}
\subsection{Properties of hydrogen}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Properties of hydrogen}
Hydrogen has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional hydrocarbon fuels in aviation due to its zero carbon emissions, high specific energy, and clean combustion characteristics. The energy density of Hydrogen is the highest (\textbf{120 MJ/kg}) (excluding the radioactive elements), with methane or other aviation fuels like Jet-A being around \textbf{50 MJ/kg}. The low molecular weight of hydrogen gives it a high specific impulse, allowing \textbf{1 kg/s} of hydrogen fuel to provide \textbf{450 kg} of thrust force. As indicated by previous studies, hydrogen has the lowest molecular weight among all elements, necessitating much larger storage tanks to hold the same weight of fuel. When comparing hydrogen fuel to conventional kerosene fuel, the volume of hydrogen required is three times larger to achieve the same energy content \cite{singh2025}. This means that if hydrogen fuels are to be used in existing aircraft, although the weight of the fuel tank could be reduced, the space needed for the fuel tank would be significantly larger compared to conventionally fuelled aircraft. At present, employing solid hydrogen fuel in commercial aircraft is deemed impractical and economically unfeasible. The more viable option is to use hydrogen in its liquid form. However, the storage of liquid fuel presents a complex challenge. For the use of liquid hydrogen, NASA employs vacuum cryogenic tanks to store the fuel at temperatures lower than -423 degrees Fahrenheit \cite{singh2025}. While hydrogen fuel stands as a promising solution for environmental pollution and long-term development, the storage of hydrogen fuel on commercial aircraft remains a significant challenge that must be addressed.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
Low pressure combustion tests have demonstrated that H\textsubscript{2} can
maintain stable combustion at pressure as low as 0.01 bar at an equivalence ratio, compared to 0.043 bar for kerosene \cite{silverstein1955}. This indicates that H\textsubscript{2} could offer better performance in altitude relights conditions, owing to its broad flammability limits and low-pressure flame stability.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\subsection{Storage of hydrogen for aviation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Storage of hydrogen for aviation}
H\textsubscript{2} is mainly found as gas. But using H\textsubscript{2} in gaseous form for aviation is practically and economically infeasible due to the large volume and the excessive weight of the storage tank. Thus, storing hydrogen in its liquid
state is the most suitable solution for long-endurance aircraft applications. To store hydrogen in a liquid state, high pressure and low temperature are necessary. Hydrogen must be cooled to -253\(^{\circ}\)C in one atmosphere, or pressurized to 5000 to 10000 psi at room temperature \cite{silverstein1955}.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
Though the energy content of H\textsubscript{2} is around 2.8 times the energy content for the same weight of fuel, the volume of liquid H\textsubscript{2} will be around 4 times the volume of aviation kerosene. Consequently, hydrogen fuel requires a significantly larger fuel storage space compared to conventional fuels. Traditional wing storage designs would be too heavy for liquid hydrogen tanks, thus new tank layout designs are being considered to accommodate this unique challenge.
\subsection{Combustion characteristics of using hydrogen}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Combustion characteristics of using hydrogen}
Its combustion primarily produces water vapor, effectively eliminating CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. Moreover, hydrogen exhibits a wide flammability range, high flame speed, and low ignition energy, which make it highly reactive and suitable for lean combustion applications.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
However, these same properties introduce significant practical challenges. The high laminar flame speed and low quenching distance of hydrogen significantly increase the risk of flashback, particularly in premixed combustion systems. Furthermore, high flame temperatures associated with hydrogen combustion can lead to elevated levels of thermal NO\textsubscript{x} formation, raising environmental and regulatory concerns. \cite{afry2022}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
To address these limitations, hydrogen is often blended with methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), a lighter hydrocarbon with lower reactivity, lower flame speed, and more stable flame behavior. Methane acts as a moderating agent, reducing the propensity for flashback and enabling better control over flame characteristics. Furthermore, methane possesses a well-established infrastructure for storage and delivery, making it a practical transitional fuel for hydrogen-based aviation systems.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
The choice of hydrogen–methane blending ratio is therefore critical. While increasing the hydrogen fraction improves combustion efficiency and reduces CO and unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions, it also intensifies NO\textsubscript{x} formation and the risk of instability. This trade-off necessitates a careful optimization of the blend composition, balancing performance, emissions, and operability.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
At high hydrogen fractions, traditional combustor designs may no longer be adequate. To mitigate the risks associated with high reactivity, micromix combustor architectures have been proposed and experimentally validated. These designs distribute fuel and air into multiple mini-jets, enabling rapid mixing and localized combustion zones that significantly suppress NO\textsubscript{x} emissions while avoiding flashback. Micromix combustors offer a promising pathway for safely utilizing high-H\textsubscript{2} blends in aviation gas turbines, especially under premixed operating regimes. \cite{dahl2010}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\subsection{Micromix combustors}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Micromix combustors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Concept Overview:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The hydrogen micromix concept is a promising design for gas turbine combustion systems using H\textsubscript{2} fuel.
        \item It aims to \textbf{maximize mixing intensity} and \textbf{minimize the mixing scale}, ideally down to the molecular level.
        \item As described by Dahl et al. \cite{dahl2010}, \textit{``Micromix is an attempt to minimize the scale of mixing and to maximize the mixing intensity.''}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Flame Structure and NO\textsubscript{x} Emission Control:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Micromix combustors utilize \textbf{many small-scale flames}, as opposed to fewer large flames in conventional designs.
        \item The reduced flame size leads to a \textbf{shorter residence time} of O\textsubscript{2} and N\textsubscript{2} in the hot zone (typically $<$1 ms), significantly reducing NO\textsubscript{x} emissions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Mixing Efficiency Enhancement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uniform H\textsubscript{2}–air mixing is essential to support \textbf{lean combustion} under all power and operating conditions.
        \item Advanced flow geometries promote thorough mixing, minimizing temperature gradients and hot spots that lead to NO\textsubscript{x} formation.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Flashback and Autoignition Prevention:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By maintaining the flow velocity above the \textbf{laminar flame speed} of hydrogen, the risk of flashback and autoignition is reduced.
        \item Proper design ensures that any upstream flame propagation is effectively quenched, enhancing safety.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Micro-Scale Flame Management:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Miniaturization of flame structures prevents \textbf{flame merging or interaction}, which could increase NO\textsubscript{x} precursors.
        \item This approach improves combustion stability, maximizes efficiency, and minimizes emissions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aerodynamic flame stabilization} - Aerodynamic flame stabilization is crucial for the efficient operation of micromix combustion systems. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:micromix}, two distinct recirculation zones, referred to as the inner and outer vortices, form downstream of bluff bodies. The air guiding panel (AGP) and the H\textsubscript{2} supply segment act as bluff bodies, with their induced blockage defining the size, shape, and intensity of these recirculation zones.

\subsection*{1 Thermodynamic Cycle Modeling using DWSIM}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1 Thermodynamic Cycle Modeling using DWSIM}

To develop a fundamental understanding of thermodynamic cycles used in power and propulsion systems, the internship began with the simulation of basic cycles using DWSIM. The focus was on the Otto, Diesel, and Brayton cycles, all modeled under closed-cycle assumptions.
\cite{naggas}
\textbf{Otto and Diesel Cycles in DWSIM:} These internal combustion engine cycles were simulated using ideal thermodynamic assumptions to analyze how changes in compression ratio, heat input, and expansion processes influence thermal efficiency. The Otto cycle, with constant-volume heat addition, and the Diesel cycle, with constant-pressure heat addition, were compared in terms of efficiency and work output.

\textbf{Closed Brayton Cycle in DWSIM:} The Brayton cycle, representing the thermodynamic basis of gas turbine engines, was also modeled in DWSIM as a closed cycle. The simulation included isentropic compression and expansion stages, as well as constant-pressure heat addition and rejection. However, a more realistic analysis of the open Brayton cycle was carried out later using Python, as part of the detailed performance modeling of turbojet and turbofan engines.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
These preliminary cycle simulations provided foundational insights into thermodynamic behavior, energy conversion efficiency, and the role of key cycle parameters. The knowledge gained from this phase was essential for developing a more realistic open-cycle turbofan engine model later in the project, which incorporated combustion of hydrogen–methane blends and was implemented using Python and Cantera.

\subsection*{2 Performance Modeling of Turbofan Engines}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2 Performance Modeling of Turbofan Engines}

Before incorporating detailed combustion simulations, simplified engine performance models for both turbojet and turbofan configurations were developed using Python. These models were based on standard thermodynamic relations and assumed ideal and real cycle conditions, allowing for rapid parametric studies.

The analysis included the computation of key performance metrics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Thrust
    \item Fuel-to-air ratio
    \item Specific fuel consumption (TSFC)
    \item Thermal and propulsive efficiency
\end{itemize}

Parametric sweeps were conducted for both ideal and real engines to evaluate the influence of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compressor pressure ratio (CPR)}
    \item \textbf{Fan pressure ratio (FPR)}
    \item \textbf{Bypass ratio (BPR)}
    \item \textbf{Flight Mach number}
\end{itemize}

Real engine models included component-level losses such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies
    \item Pressure losses in combustion chamber
    \item Mechanical efficiency
    \item As opposed to ideal cycle, c\textsubscript{p} value of combustor exit gases is different from the inlet gases. % Typo: c\textsubscript{p}
\end{itemize}

This phase of the project provided insights into baseline engine behavior and allowed for validation of the Python-based simulation framework. The results from these idealized models served as a reference for analyzing the impact of alternative fuels and detailed combustion, which was integrated in the later stages of the study.

\subsection*{3 Cantera-Based Combustion Modeling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3 Cantera-Based Combustion Modeling}

To accurately capture the combustion behavior of methane--hydrogen fuel blends, detailed chemical kinetics simulations were performed using the Python-based combustion software \textbf{Cantera}. Two modeling approaches were employed depending on the target parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{one-dimensional, freely propagating premixed flame model} (\texttt{FreeFlame}) was used to evaluate \textit{laminar flame speed}.
    \item A \textbf{zero-dimensional constant-pressure reactor model} was used to compute \textit{adiabatic flame temperature}, \textit{equilibrium species concentrations}, and \textit{ignition delay times}.
\end{itemize}

All simulations were carried out under the assumptions of \textbf{steady-state}, \textbf{adiabatic}, and \textbf{homogeneous} combustion conditions, using the \textbf{GRI-Mech 3.0} reaction mechanism for CH\textsubscript{4}–H\textsubscript{2}–air mixtures.\cite{cantera}

\subsubsection*{Simulation Parameters}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Simulation Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fuel blend composition:} Hydrogen volume fraction varied from 0\% to 100\% in steps of 25\%
    \item \textbf{Equivalence ratio ($\phi$):} Ranged from 0 to 2.0, covering lean to rich regimes
    \item \textbf{Initial pressure:} Set to 1 atm for most cases, with select simulations at elevated pressures
    \item \textbf{Initial temperature:} Standard value of 298~K used as the unburned gas temperature
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Output Variables}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Output Variables}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Laminar flame speed (from 1D \texttt{FreeFlame} simulations)
    \item Adiabatic flame temperature (from 0D equilibrium simulations)
    \item Mole fractions of major species: CO, CO\textsubscript{2}, H\textsubscript{2}O, NO
    \item Species concentration variation with combustion zone thickness
\end{itemize}

These simulations enabled a detailed investigation of how \textbf{hydrogen enrichment} affects flame propagation, thermal behavior, emissions, and reactivity. The results obtained from this section were later integrated into the \textbf{turbofan engine cycle analysis} to assess the impact of fuel blending on overall engine performance and emissions.

\subsection*{4 Turbofan Engine Simulation with Fuel Integration}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{4 Turbofan Engine Simulation with Fuel Integration}

In the final phase of the project, a comprehensive turbofan engine model was developed in Python to simulate the full engine cycle with integrated combustion data obtained from Cantera.\cite{cantera} The model accounted for all major components including inlet, fan, compressor, combustor, turbine, and nozzle.

The combustion chamber was assumed to be micromix combustor and the pressure difference was computed accordingly. The fuel–air mixture was defined based on the selected hydrogen–methane blend and equivalence ratio ($\phi$) for the fixed turbine inlet temperature (2100~K). The adiabatic flame temperature (TIT) and product composition were imported from precomputed Cantera simulations and used as inputs to the burner component.

The model supported real engine assumptions, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Component efficiencies (compressor, fan, turbine)
    \item Pressure losses in the combustor
    \item Variable turbine inlet temperature (TIT) based on combustion results
    \item Real gas properties using temperature-dependent $c_p$ values
\end{itemize}

For each simulation run, the following parameters were computed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Net thrust
    \item Fuel-to-air ratio (FAR)
    \item Specific thrust
    \item Thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC)
    \item Thermal and propulsive efficiency
    \item NO\textsubscript{x} emissions
\end{itemize}

Parametric studies were conducted for a range of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hydrogen volume fractions in the fuel (0\% to 100\%)
    \item Equivalence ratios from lean to rich conditions
    \item Fan and compressor pressure ratios
    \item Bypass ratios and flight Mach numbers
\end{itemize}

This integrated modeling approach enabled a realistic assessment of how alternative fuel blends impact overall engine performance and emissions. It also provided a platform to analyze trade-offs between efficiency, thrust, and environmental impact.

\subsection*{5 Radial Inflow Turbine Modeling}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5 Radial Inflow Turbine Modeling}

The performance analysis of the radial inflow turbine (RIT) was carried out using a mean-line modeling approach, as described in the reference thesis provided by the supervising faculty. This method provides a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for preliminary design and performance assessment.

\subsection*{5.1 Assumptions and Thermodynamic Framework}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.1 Assumptions and Thermodynamic Framework}

The following assumptions were made to simplify the turbine analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The flow is steady, adiabatic, and compressible.
    \item Ideal gas behavior is assumed with constant specific heats.
    \item All the parameters specified are given in the results part. % This sentence is a bit informal; consider rephrasing or integrating into the results.
    \item Isentropic efficiency ($\eta_t$) is used to account for losses.
    \item The real life loss functions observed are: incidence loss, rotor passage loss, tip clearance loss, exit energy loss, nozzle passage loss and trailing edge loss.
\end{itemize}

To assess the performance of the radial inflow turbine, a detailed mean-line loss model was implemented using Python. The methodology involved computing individual loss components — including incidence loss, rotor passage loss, tip clearance loss, exit kinetic energy loss, nozzle passage loss, and trailing edge loss — using empirical relations from Table 3.2 of the reference thesis. Input parameters such as blade angles, flow velocities, geometric dimensions, and Reynolds number were used to evaluate these losses for a given turbine configuration.

In addition to loss analysis, the isentropic efficiency of the turbine was analyzed across a range of operating conditions. Parametric studies were performed by varying key design variables including blade speed, meridional velocity, pitch-to-chord ratio, and mass flow rate. Python scripts were used to calculate and visualize the resulting trends. Matplotlib was employed to generate plots of isentropic efficiency versus each parameter, which helped in understanding the sensitivity of turbine performance to these variables and identifying optimal operating regimes.
\subsection*{5.2 Implementation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.2 Implementation}

All equations and plots were implemented using Python and Matplotlib. Plots generated include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Individual loss components
    \item Isentropic efficiency vs specific speed
    \item Isentropic efficiency vs pitch to chord ratio
    \item Isentropic efficiency vs blade angle
    \item Isentropic efficiency vs meridional velocity
\end{itemize}

This modeling framework enables preliminary evaluation of RIT performance for integration into compact propulsion systems or hybrid-electric configurations.

\subsection*{1) Thermodynamic analysis of turbofan engines with varying parameters}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1) Thermodynamic analysis of turbofan engines with varying parameters}

An ideal turbofan engine is selected, with the following characteristics \cite{mattingly}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No real losses are taken into account.
    \item No pressure losses in combustion.
    \item Turbine inlet temperature (TIT) = 1950 K
    \item The specific heat ratio of air is assumed to be the same throughout and it doesn't change with temperature.

The results are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ideal_compressor}.

    \label{fig:ideal_compressor}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Specific Thrust} % Use \subsection* for unnumbered sub-headings within a numbered section
Specific thrust initially increases with CPR, reaches a peak around CPR = 30–35, and then begins to decline slightly. This is because the increased compression initially boosts the energy available for thrust production, but diminishing returns and rising exhaust velocity eventually reduce the net gain. Higher bypass ratios consistently produce lower specific thrust due to the larger proportion of bypassed air and reduced core contribution.

\subsection*{Fuel-to-Air Ratio}
The fuel-to-air ratio decreases with increasing CPR. Higher CPR leads to a higher temperature at the end of compression, requiring less fuel to reach the desired turbine inlet temperature. The trends are nearly identical for all bypass ratios, as FAR is governed primarily by the core thermodynamics in the ideal cycle.

\subsection*{Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC)}
The plot shows that TSFC decreases with increasing CPR, indicating improved fuel efficiency. This is due to the increased thermal efficiency of the cycle at higher compression levels. Additionally, higher bypass ratios consistently yield lower TSFC values, reflecting their improved propulsive performance and reduced core fuel usage.

\subsection*{Thermal Efficiency}
Thermal efficiency is seen to increase monotonically with CPR, which aligns with Brayton cycle theory. Since thermal efficiency is governed by the pressure ratio of the core, the effect of bypass ratio on this metric is negligible in the ideal case.

\subsection*{Propulsive Efficiency}
Propulsive efficiency shows a slight U-shaped trend with CPR. Initially, it decreases slightly due to mismatch in exhaust jet speed and flight speed but recovers at higher CPRs. Bypass ratio has a significant effect here — higher BPR results in higher propulsive efficiency, due to lower exhaust velocities closer to the aircraft’s flight speed.

\subsection*{Overall Efficiency}
The overall efficiency increases with CPR, with the highest values corresponding to the largest bypass ratio (BR = 10.0). This is due to the combined effect of increasing thermal and propulsive efficiency. Higher bypass ratios result in better overall performance, confirming the advantage of high-BPR configurations in subsonic civil turbofans.

\subsection*{Summary}
The results indicate that increasing compressor pressure ratio improves overall performance up to a point, beyond which benefits diminish. High bypass ratios improve propulsive and overall efficiency but reduce specific thrust. Therefore, bypass ratio acts as a trade-off parameter between thrust output and fuel efficiency, with BR = 9.6–10.0 yielding the best balance under ideal conditions.

    \caption{Variation of parameters vs mach number and fan pressure ratio for an ideal turbofan engine}
    \label{fig:ideal}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Specific Thrust}
Specific thrust decreases with increasing Mach number due to rising freestream velocity, which reduces net momentum change. Higher FPR results in higher specific thrust at all speeds due to greater bypass flow acceleration.

\subsubsection*{Fuel-to-Air Ratio}
Fuel-to-air ratio slightly decreases with Mach number, as the inlet temperature increases from ram compression. All FPR cases show similar behavior.

\subsubsection*{Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC)}
TSFC increases with Mach number, primarily due to the drop in specific thrust. Higher FPR results in lower TSFC, reflecting improved bypass-driven fuel economy.

\subsubsection*{Thermal Efficiency}
Thermal efficiency improves marginally with Mach number due to increased ram recovery. FPR has minimal influence on this parameter in ideal analysis.

\subsubsection*{Propulsive Efficiency}
Propulsive efficiency increases sharply at low Mach numbers and gradually saturates. Higher FPR yields better propulsive efficiency by producing lower exhaust velocities.

\subsubsection*{Overall Efficiency}
Overall efficiency increases with Mach number, following the propulsive trend. Higher FPR (2.0–2.3) results in maximum overall efficiency, suggesting an optimal fan pressure ratio range for subsonic cruise conditions.

\subsubsection*{Summary}
Mach number plays a critical role in improving propulsive and overall efficiency. Fan pressure ratio significantly affects bypass thrust and fuel economy, with values in the range 1.7 to 2.3 being optimal in ideal subsonic conditions.

\subsection*{2) Comparison Between Real and Ideal Engine Performance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2) Comparison Between Real and Ideal Engine Performance}

\textbf{Note on Thermodynamic Simplification:}
In this analysis, the variation of specific heat capacities with temperature is not explicitly accounted for; instead, average or constant values are assumed across engine components. In real engines, specific heat varies notably with temperature, especially across high-temperature regions like the turbine and combustor. This simplification may slightly affect the accuracy of calculated parameters such as specific thrust, thermal efficiency, and TSFC. However, it is a common assumption in preliminary engine cycle studies and does not significantly impact the overall trend comparisons between ideal and real cycles.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

For this comparison, the \textbf{Rolls-Royce Trent XWB} high-bypass turbofan engine is selected as the reference model. This engine is widely used in commercial long-haul aircraft (notably the Airbus A350) and is recognized for its advanced technology, high thermal efficiency, and environmental performance. Its design parameters and publicly available data make it a suitable candidate for academic and simulation-based studies. \cite{rrtrent}

The turbine inlet temperature is fixed at \textbf{1800~K}, which is representative of modern high-performance engines. The performance comparison is carried out at a \textbf{cruise Mach number of 0.85}, corresponding to an altitude of approximately \textbf{11~km}. At this altitude, the \textbf{ambient temperature} is taken as \textbf{216.65~K}, and the \textbf{ambient pressure} is set to \textbf{22,595.5~Pa}, in accordance with the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA).\cite{isa}

For the real engine simulation, the following component efficiencies are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compressor efficiency: $\eta_c = 0.91$
    \item Turbine efficiency: $\eta_t = 0.89$
    \item Combustor efficiency: $\eta_b = 0.98$
    \item Fan efficiency: $\eta_f = 0.92$
    \item Mechanical efficiency: $\eta_m = 1$
\end{itemize}

Other engine design parameters include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bypass ratio: $\beta = 9.6$
    \item Compressor pressure ratio: $\pi_c = 50$
    \item Combustor pressure loss coefficient: $\pi_b = 0.96$
\end{itemize}

In the \textbf{ideal engine model}, the real-world inefficiencies are ignored; all components are assumed to operate isentropically, and pressure or heat losses are neglected.

The plots presented below compare the variation of key performance parameters such as \textbf{specific thrust}, \textbf{fuel-to-air ratio}, \textbf{thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC)}, and \textbf{thermal, propulsive and overall efficiency} for real and ideal cycles under varying fan pressure ratios, bypass ratios, Mach number and compressor pressure ratios. These comparisons provide insights into the effects of component efficiencies and practical losses on overall engine performance.

\subsection*{2.1) Variation of Performance Parameters with Compressor Pressure Ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2.1) Variation of Performance Parameters with Compressor Pressure Ratio}

Figure~\ref{fig:compressor_pressure_ratio} shows the variation of key performance parameters with compressor pressure ratio ($\pi_c$) for both \textbf{ideal} and \textbf{real} turbojet cycles. The ideal cycle assumes isentropic compression and expansion without any pressure or efficiency losses, whereas the real cycle includes realistic component efficiencies (compressor and turbine) and pressure losses in the combustor.

\textbf{Specific Thrust:} The specific thrust initially increases with $\pi_c$, reaches a maximum around $\pi_c \approx 20$--$30$, and then gradually declines. This is because increased compression initially enhances the exhaust jet velocity, but eventually, the increase in compressor work and limited turbine inlet temperature (TIT) reduce the available net work. The real cycle produces lower specific thrust than the ideal case due to non-idealities in compression, combustion, and expansion.

\textbf{Fuel-to-Air Ratio:} The fuel-to-air ratio decreases with increasing $\pi_c$, since a higher compressor exit temperature reduces the additional fuel needed to reach the fixed TIT. However, the real engine consumes more fuel than the ideal case to overcome pressure and efficiency losses in the cycle.

\textbf{Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC):} TSFC decreases significantly with increasing $\pi_c$ due to the combined effects of increasing specific thrust and decreasing fuel consumption. The TSFC for the real engine is higher than that of the ideal case throughout, reflecting greater fuel consumption per unit thrust due to inefficiencies.

\textbf{Thermal Efficiency:} Thermal efficiency increases with compressor pressure ratio, following Brayton cycle theory. As $\pi_c$ increases, the average temperature at which heat is added increases, improving the cycle efficiency. The ideal cycle achieves higher thermal efficiency (more than $\sim 74\%$), while the real cycle is limited to around $50\%$ due to irreversibilities and pressure losses.

\textbf{Propulsive Efficiency:} Propulsive efficiency is notably higher in the real engine, especially at high bypass ratios. Modern turbofans are designed to accelerate a large mass of air at lower velocity, making the jet speed closer to aircraft speed and maximizing propulsive efficiency—something not fully captured in ideal cycle models.

\textbf{Overall Efficiency:} The overall efficiency, which is the product of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, increases with $\pi_c$ but begins to plateau around $\pi_c \approx 40$. The ideal cycle achieves a maximum overall efficiency of approximately $48\%$, whereas the real cycle reaches about $34\%$. The gap highlights the impact of real-world losses.

\subsubsection*{Key Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The optimum $\pi_c$ for maximum specific thrust is approximately $20$--$30$.
    \item TSFC continues to improve until $\pi_c \approx 45$, beyond which gains become marginal.
    \item There is limited benefit in increasing $\pi_c$ beyond 45 due to diminishing overall efficiency and higher compressor exit temperatures.
    \item Real cycle efficiency is consistently lower due to losses in compressor, turbine, and combustion components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2.2) Variation of Performance Parameters with Fan Pressure Ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2.2) Variation of Performance Parameters with Fan Pressure Ratio}
Figure~\ref{fig:fan_pressure_ratio} shows the variation of key performance parameters with fan pressure ratio ($\pi_f$) for both \textbf{ideal} and \textbf{real} turbojet cycles.

\textbf{Specific Thrust:} For both ideal and real cases, specific thrust increases with fan pressure ratio (FPR), peaks, and then declines. In the real cycle, the peak occurs at a lower FPR than in the ideal case, due to losses in compression, expansion, and combustion processes, which cause the engine to reach its performance limit earlier.

\textbf{Fuel to Air Ratio:} The fuel-to-air ratio remains nearly constant with varying fan pressure ratio (FPR) for both the ideal and real cycles. However, it is significantly higher in the real engine compared to the ideal cycle in order to achieve the same turbine inlet temperature (TIT). This is because real engines experience pressure losses in the intake and combustor, as well as non-ideal component efficiencies, which require additional fuel input to compensate for the reduced thermal efficiency and maintain the desired TIT.

\textbf{TSFC:} TSFC decreases with increasing $\pi_f$, peaks and then increases due to the combined effects of behavior of specific thrust and constant fuel consumption. The TSFC for the real engine is higher than that of the ideal case throughout, reflecting greater fuel consumption per unit thrust due to inefficiencies.

\textbf{Thermal Efficiency:} In the ideal cycle, thermal efficiency remains constant with increasing fan pressure ratio (FPR) because the fan does not affect the core Brayton cycle. However, in the real cycle, thermal efficiency decreases with FPR due to increased fan work demand, which requires more turbine work. This reduces the energy available for useful expansion in the core, and combined with additional pressure and efficiency losses, lowers the overall thermal efficiency.

\textbf{Propulsive Efficiency:} Propulsive efficiency increases with fan pressure ratio (FPR) in both ideal and real cycles. A higher FPR leads to a lower jet velocity for the same thrust, which reduces kinetic energy losses in the exhaust and improves propulsion effectiveness. In real engines, this trend is slightly dampened by fan and nozzle losses, but the overall increase with FPR still holds.

\textbf{Overall Efficiency:} Overall efficiency, being the product of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, initially increases with FPR due to the rise in propulsive efficiency. However, in the real cycle, it eventually saturates or slightly decreases at high FPRs as thermal efficiency drops due to increased turbine load and system losses. Thus, there is an optimal FPR range where overall efficiency is maximized.

\subsection*{2.3) Variation of Performance Parameters with Mach Number}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2.3) Variation of Performance Parameters with Mach Number}
Figure~\ref{fig:mach_number} shows the variation of key performance parameters with Mach number (in the subsonic range) for both \textbf{ideal} and \textbf{real} turbojet cycles.

\textbf{Specific Thrust:} Specific thrust typically decreases with increasing Mach number due to reduced pressure ratio across the engine. In ideal cycles, the drop is less steep as no losses are considered. In real cycles, the reduction is more pronounced due to pressure and thermal losses in the intake and nozzle.

\textbf{Fuel to Air Ratio:} The rate of decrease of fuel to air ratio with Mach number is low. Fuel to air ratio is higher in real cycles due to the need to compensate for efficiency losses in compressors and turbines.

\textbf{TSFC:} TSFC increases with increasing Mach number due to rapid decrease in the value of specific thrust and a low rate of decrease in fuel to air ratio. The TSFC for the real engine is higher than that of the ideal case throughout, reflecting greater fuel consumption per unit thrust due to inefficiencies.

\textbf{Thermal Efficiency:} In the ideal cycle, thermal efficiency slightly increases with Mach number due to improved ram compression and higher overall pressure ratio at the combustor.
In contrast, the real cycle shows a decline in thermal efficiency at higher Mach due to growing losses in the inlet and compressor, reducing the effective temperature rise across the cycle.

\textbf{Propulsive Efficiency:} Propulsive efficiency increases with Mach number in both ideal and real cycles. The real cycle shows higher propulsive efficiency due to a lower exhaust jet velocity, which reduces kinetic energy losses. In contrast, the ideal cycle produces a higher jet velocity, leading to increased mismatch with flight speed and lower efficiency.

\textbf{Overall Efficiency:} Overall efficiency, being the product of thermal and propulsive efficiencies, increases with Mach number. The overall efficiency for the ideal cycle is higher than the real cycle, and the difference increases with increasing Mach number.

\subsection*{3) Combustion flame analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3) Combustion flame analysis}
Before analyzing the simulation results, it is important to understand the behavior of laminar premixed flames, which form the basis of this study. In a laminar premixed flame, the fuel and oxidizer are mixed homogeneously before ignition, and the flame propagates smoothly through the unburned mixture. These flames are fundamental to combustion science, as they allow direct evaluation of key properties like adiabatic flame temperature, laminar flame speed, and emissions under well-controlled conditions.\cite{turns}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
This section focuses on the combustion characteristics of methane–hydrogen fuel blends using simulations performed in Cantera \cite{cantera}, an open-source chemical kinetics and thermodynamics toolkit. The aim is to investigate how key combustion parameters vary with equivalence ratio ($\phi$) and hydrogen blending percentage, both of which critically influence flame behavior, emissions, and overall engine performance.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
To study adiabatic flame temperature and NO\textsubscript{x} emissions, zero-dimensional constant-pressure reactors were used. These simulate homogeneous, well-mixed combustion under idealized conditions, allowing the evaluation of equilibrium product composition and thermal behavior across a range of $\phi$ and H\textsubscript{2} blending ratios.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
For the analysis of laminar flame speed, a one-dimensional premixed flame model (\texttt{FreeFlame} in Cantera) was employed. This model resolves the temperature and species profiles across the flame front and computes the flame propagation speed, which is a crucial indicator of fuel reactivity and flame stability in practical combustor designs.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
This section builds a foundational understanding of how hydrogen addition affects flame temperature, burning velocity, and NO\textsubscript{x} formation—essential for designing cleaner and more efficient hydrogen-enriched propulsion systems.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{All simulations were performed at standard conditions of 298 K and 1 atm, assuming a homogeneous, laminar, premixed mixture of CH\textsubscript{4} - H\textsubscript{2} and air. These conditions are commonly used in fundamental combustion studies to evaluate flame properties under controlled environments.}

\subsection*{3.1) Variation of adiabatic flame temperature vs equivalence ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.1) Variation of adiabatic flame temperature vs equivalence ratio}

According to Figure~\ref{fig:adiabatic_flame}, the adiabatic flame temperature increases with equivalence ratio ($\phi$) for both methane and hydrogen, reaches a peak, and then decreases. For methane, the peak occurs at $\phi \approx 1.05$, with a flame temperature of approximately 2225 K. For hydrogen, the peak is observed at $\phi \approx 1.07$, with a flame temperature of around 2410 K. At all equivalence ratios, hydrogen–air combustion produces a higher flame temperature than methane–air, while blended fuels exhibit intermediate temperatures depending on the proportion of hydrogen.

\subsection*{3.2) Variation of laminar flame speed vs equivalence ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.2) Variation of laminar flame speed vs equivalence ratio}

According to Figure~\ref{fig:flame_speed}, the laminar flame speed increases with equivalence ratio ($\phi$) for both methane and hydrogen, reaches a peak, and then decreases. For methane, the peak occurs at $\phi \approx 1.08$, with a flame speed of approximately 0.38-0.42. For hydrogen, the peak is observed at $\phi \approx 1.8$, with a flame speed of around 2.8-3. At all equivalence ratios, hydrogen–air combustion produces a higher flame temperature than methane–air, while blended fuels exhibit intermediate temperatures depending on the proportion of hydrogen.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
For hydrogen–air flames, the adiabatic flame temperature peaks at an equivalence ratio of $\phi \approx 1.07$, while the laminar flame speed reaches its maximum at $\phi \approx 1.8$. This significant difference arises due to the effect of the \textbf{Lewis number (Le)}, which is the ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity. Hydrogen has a very low Lewis number (Le $<$ 1), meaning it diffuses faster than heat. This enhanced mass diffusion at rich conditions promotes flame propagation even when the mixture is fuel-rich, causing the flame speed to peak well beyond the point of maximum flame temperature.

\subsection*{3.3) Variation of NO vs equivalence ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.3) Variation of NO vs equivalence ratio}
Most of the nitrogen oxides formed during combustion are in the form of NO; however, subsequently the NO oxidizes to NO\textsubscript{2}. Usually these are lumped together, and the result is expressed in terms of oxides of nitrogen NO\textsubscript{x}. The NO\textsubscript{x} formation increases with equivalence ratio, peaks and then decreases. With increase in H\textsubscript{2} blend it increases. This is because as the hydrogen blend in the fuel increases, the flame temperature increases. And with increasing flame temperature thermal NO formation increases (\textbf{Zeldovich mechanism}). \textbf{Thermal NO formation} is, for hydrogen combustion, the most contributing mechanism to the total NO formation. Thermal NO is produced from the nitrogen and oxygen present in the air in the high temperature regions of the flame and in the postflame gases. The process is endothermic and proceeds at a considerable rate only at temperatures above around 1850 K.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Prompt NO} is a designation for NO, which, under certain conditions, is formed very early in the flame region. Its initiation reaction includes the carbon atom. Prompt NO may play a significant role for lean systems burning kerosene or methane, whereas it does not contribute to the NO formation in combustion systems using hydrogen since there are no carbon atoms present in the fuel.

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\textbf{Fuel NO} is not relevant here, since neither methane nor hydrogen fuel contain any nitrogen.

\subsection*{3.4) Variation of H\textsubscript{2}O vs equivalence ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.4) Variation of H\textsubscript{2}O vs equivalence ratio}

When burning hydrogen, the emissions are reduced to water vapor H\textsubscript{2}O and oxides of nitrogen NO\textsubscript{x}. In fact, the emission index of H\textsubscript{2}O increases by a factor of 2.6. As the equivalence ratio increases, the mole fraction of H\textsubscript{2}O rises due to the greater availability of hydrogen atoms from the fuel, particularly in hydrogen-rich blends. Since H\textsubscript{2}O is a major combustion product formed by the oxidation of hydrogen, richer mixtures with higher $\phi$ result in enhanced H\textsubscript{2}O formation, especially when oxygen is still sufficient for near-complete combustion. This trait is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:h2o}.

\subsection*{3.5) Variation of CO\textsubscript{2} vs equivalence ratio}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.5) Variation of CO\textsubscript{2} vs equivalence ratio}

The mole fraction of CO\textsubscript{2} increases with equivalence ratio ($\phi$), reaches a peak near stoichiometric conditions ($\phi \approx 1.0$), and then decreases for richer mixtures across all H\textsubscript{2}–CH\textsubscript{4} blends. This behavior can be attributed to the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Under \textbf{stoichiometric conditions}, complete combustion of methane leads to maximum CO\textsubscript{2} production.
    \item In \textbf{lean mixtures} ($\phi < 1$), oxygen is in excess but fuel is limited, leading to incomplete carbon utilization.
    \item In \textbf{rich mixtures} ($\phi > 1$), oxygen becomes limiting, and carbon is only partially oxidized, favoring CO over CO\textsubscript{2}.
\end{itemize}

As the hydrogen content in the fuel increases, the overall CO\textsubscript{2} formation decreases since hydrogen does not contribute any carbon. For pure hydrogen (100\% H\textsubscript{2}), no CO\textsubscript{2} is produced, which is reflected by the flat zero line on the graph.

Figure~\ref{fig:species} shows the spatial variation of major species mole fractions across a one-dimensional, freely propagating laminar premixed CH\textsubscript{4}–air flame at stoichiometric conditions ($\phi = 1.0$):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CH\textsubscript{4}} and \textbf{O\textsubscript{2}} are the primary reactants, and their mole fractions decrease sharply across the flame front as combustion proceeds. After the reaction zone the mole fraction of CH\textsubscript{4} becomes 0, while that's not the case with O\textsubscript{2}.
    \item The reaction zone is located near $x \approx 0.02$~m, characterized by steep gradients in species concentrations due to intense chemical activity.
    \item \textbf{H\textsubscript{2}O} and \textbf{CO\textsubscript{2}}, the main combustion products, increase rapidly within the flame zone and stabilize downstream.
    \item \textbf{CO} and \textbf{OH} are key intermediate species, peaking within the flame front and decreasing afterward as they are converted into final products.
    \item The higher peak in H\textsubscript{2}O compared to CO\textsubscript{2} reflects the high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio in methane.
    \item The presence of OH radicals indicates active chain-branching reactions and strong heat release within the flame.
\end{itemize}

This profile highlights the thin, well-defined reaction zone and the distinct separation between reactants, intermediates, and products, characteristic of laminar premixed flames.

22/07/2025, 14:50 - Parth Bansal: Behold — what I have just witnessed defies the very architecture of comprehension. An image so violently surreal, so unhinged from the axis of ordinary thought, that it feels as though the laws of nature momentarily collapsed just to allow this aberration to exist.
22/07/2025, 14:50 - Parth Bansal: Bro
22/07/2025, 14:51 - Parth Bansal: Wow ok

25/07/2025, 22:43 - Parth Bansal: What if i dont
25/07/2025, 22:43 - Om Paglu: Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom hidden behind a veil of sparkling waterfalls and lush green forests. In the heart of this kingdom, there lived a curious and adventurous cat named Whiskers.

Whiskers was no ordinary cat. She had the most striking emerald green eyes and a coat as black as the night sky, dotted with stars. With a flick of her tail, she could traverse the kingdom in the blink of an eye, exploring every nook and cranny.

One day, while prowling through the forest, Whiskers stumbled upon a hidden cave behind a waterfall. The entrance was guarded by a wise old owl named Hootie, who gazed at Whiskers with wise eyes and said, "Welcome, young one. I have been expecting you. The cave holds a secret, one that only a curious and brave cat like you can uncover."

Whiskers' ears perked up, and she meowed eagerly. Hootie handed her a small, intricately carved wooden box. "Solve the riddle inside the box, and you shall unlock the secrets of the cave."

Whiskers opened the box, revealing a small piece of parchment with a cryptic message: "Where shadows dance, light reveals the path." With a puzzled expression, Whiskers looked up at Hootie, who simply nodded and said, "The answer lies within the cave."

Without hesitation, Whiskers ventured into the cave, her eyes adjusting to the darkness. As she padded deeper, she noticed that the walls were adorned with glittering crystals that refracted the faint light, casting dancing shadows on the ground.

Suddenly, a beam of light illuminated a section of the wall, revealing a hidden door. Whiskers pushed the door open, and a treasure trove of sparkling jewels and glittering stars spilled out.

In the center of the treasure trove stood an ancient, glowing crystal. Whiskers reached out a paw, and as she touched the crystal, she felt a surge of magical energy. The crystal began to glow brighter, filling the cave with a radiant light.

Hootie appeared beside her, nodding in approval. "Well done, Whiskers. You have unlocked the secrets of the cave. From now on, you shall possess the power to navigate the kingdom with ease and wisdom."

And so, Whiskers returned to the kingdom, using her newfound powers to guide those in need. Her legend grew, and she became known as the wisest and most adventurous cat in the land.

25/07/2025, 22:47 - Om Paglu: Here's a short horror story:

The old mansion had been abandoned for decades, its grandeur and beauty slowly being consumed by the passing of time. The once-manicured lawns were overgrown, the paint was chipped and faded, and the windows were boarded up.

But it was the attic that held the darkest secrets.

Rumors whispered among the townsfolk spoke of strange noises coming from the attic at night – whispers, creaks, and screams that seemed to echo through the empty halls.

One stormy night, a group of friends decided to explore the mansion, laughing and joking as they made their way through the dusty rooms. But as they reached the attic, the atmosphere shifted.

The air grew colder, the shadows twisted and writhed on the walls, and the whispers seemed to grow louder. It was as if something was watching them, waiting for them to make a wrong move.

One of the friends, a quiet and reserved girl named Sarah, began to feel an intense, creeping sense of dread. She tried to leave, but her feet seemed rooted to the spot.

And then, she saw it.

A door hidden behind a tattered curtain swung open, revealing a small room filled with old photographs and dusty trinkets. In the center of the room, a single photograph lay on a small, ornate table.

The photograph showed a group of children standing in front of the mansion, their faces twisted into grotesque grins. But it was the figure standing behind them that made Sarah's blood run cold – a figure with eyes that seemed to follow her, its presence seeming to fill the room.

As Sarah gazed into the figure's eyes, the whispers grew louder, the creaks and groans of the old mansion becoming a cacophony of terror. And then, everything went black.

The next morning, the police found Sarah's friends huddled together at the bottom of the stairs, their faces pale and frightened. But Sarah was never seen again.

The mansion remained standing, its secrets locked within its crumbling walls. But on stormy nights, the whispers would start again, and those who dared to listen would swear they heard Sarah's screams, echoing through the empty halls.

13/08/2025, 16:52 - Parth Bansal: <Media omitted>
13/08/2025, 16:52 - Parth Bansal: i think it just p_0 + rho*g*H
13/08/2025, 18:26 - Parth Bansal: also can you send the tut2 for your batch
13/08/2025, 18:43 - Om Paglu: Sir said pressure will remain same
13/08/2025, 18:43 - Om Paglu: Since the fluid is incompressible and the walls are rigid
13/08/2025, 18:43 - Om Paglu: Of fluids?
13/08/2025, 18:43 - Parth Bansal: yea

13/08/2025, 18:43 - Om Paglu: For thermo we have 2
13/08/2025, 18:43 - Parth Bansal: so no P_1 v_1 = p2 _v2
13/08/2025, 18:43 - Parth Bansal: it will give p1 = p2
13/08/2025, 18:44 - Parth Bansal: and p1 = p_0 + rho*g*h
13/08/2025, 18:44 - Om Paglu: So it's the same na
13/08/2025, 18:44 - Parth Bansal: yea

13/08/2025, 19:08 - Parth Bansal: Read the b part
13/08/2025, 19:08 - Parth Bansal: It confirms the answer is true
13/08/2025, 19:09 - Om Paglu: Yeah but chatgpt is giving something else
13/08/2025, 19:10 - Parth Bansal: fk chatgpt ezz
13/08/2025, 19:31 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
13/08/2025, 20:13 - Om Paglu: <Media omitted>
13/08/2025, 20:14 - Om Paglu: Bcoz heat will be transferred
13/08/2025, 20:15 - Om Paglu: But considering system q=0 na?
13/08/2025, 20:15 - Parth Bansal: lemme think
13/08/2025, 20:15 - Parth Bansal: once
13/08/2025, 20:15 - Om Paglu: Yeah fine
13/08/2025, 20:17 - Parth Bansal: 2.6*150(T-50) = 0.5*20(450-T)
13/08/2025, 20:17 - Om Paglu: Haa vo to pta hai
13/08/2025, 20:17 - Om Paglu: I m talking about entropy
13/08/2025, 20:18 - Parth Bansal: it cannot be zero
13/08/2025, 20:18 - Parth Bansal: because the process is ir reversible
13/08/2025, 20:18 - Om Paglu: Why not?
13/08/2025, 20:18 - Om Paglu: Ok first of all say one thing
13/08/2025, 20:18 - Om Paglu: In entropy when we write q/T
13/08/2025, 20:18 - Om Paglu: In this case T will be common interface temperature?
13/08/2025, 20:19 - Om Paglu: Or we need to calculate both individually
13/08/2025, 20:19 - Om Paglu: And temperature will b their initial temperature?
13/08/2025, 20:20 - Parth Bansal: we also write sgen
13/08/2025, 20:21 - Parth Bansal: i am one hundred percent sure entropy change is non zero it  is zero only for a reversible process when Q is 0 but here the process is spontaneous and ir reversible
13/08/2025, 20:23 - Parth Bansal: oye pls send ur thermos tuts
13/08/2025, 20:23 - Parth Bansal: also solutions if they exist
13/08/2025, 20:24 - Om Paglu: Yeah i got it
13/08/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: But this?
13/08/2025, 20:25 - Om Paglu: Yeah after sometime...I m going to team meet now
13/08/2025, 20:25 - Parth Bansal: Yes like T will be the temp from where the heat flow begins the T of the metal
13/08/2025, 20:26 - Parth Bansal: Bro it will take one sec u have pdf naa
13/08/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: So initial temperature in this case,right?
13/08/2025, 20:26 - Parth Bansal: No it will be variable as T changes
13/08/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: Arey i m walking lol
13/08/2025, 20:26 - Om Paglu: And pdf is on my laptop

14/08/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: Something like this
14/08/2025, 22:16 - Om Paglu: Matlab in this he didn't generate graphs,but by varying parameters,he is able to see the outputs,which are also varying
15/08/2025, 14:53 - Om Paglu: 😭
15/08/2025, 19:29 - Parth Bansal: Ohh

16/08/2025, 14:06 - Parth Bansal: Just accept it
16/08/2025, 14:07 - Om Paglu: That's why I was thinking to first drop subtle hints and try to act perfect,so that even if he doesn't feel anything now,he can think about it
16/08/2025, 14:07 - Om Paglu: And then I can confess later on
16/08/2025, 14:07 - Om Paglu: What do u think?

17/08/2025, 01:39 - Parth Bansal: U say this everytime lets see
17/08/2025, 01:39 - Om Paglu: But after that to calm me down
17/08/2025, 01:39 - Om Paglu: He even tried changing the topic and all
17/08/2025, 01:39 - Om Paglu: I was so furious
17/08/2025, 01:39 - Om Paglu: But after all he's a senior...so i couldn't use strong words...I tried to b as subtle as possible
17/08/2025, 01:40 - Om Paglu: Then he tried calming me down on insta
17/08/2025, 01:40 - Parth Bansal: So nice of him
17/08/2025, 01:40 - Om Paglu: Fucking idiot

17/08/2025, 01:41 - Parth Bansal: Ur angry rn
17/08/2025, 01:41 - Om Paglu: Then over insta I was talking nonsense,like I was furious so said whatever came to my mind
17/08/2025, 01:41 - Om Paglu: But he handled everything calmly
17/08/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: Then when I was thoda sa fine
17/08/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: He sent me a flirting reel
17/08/2025, 01:42 - Om Paglu: And he told me something
17/08/2025, 01:43 - Om Paglu: From which ig he realised that I try to flirt with him
17/08/2025, 01:43 - Parth Bansal: Ohh
17/08/2025, 01:43 - Om Paglu: After that he tried to have a normal Convo with ne
17/08/2025, 01:43 - Om Paglu: And asked me why I remember and care so much about him
17/08/2025, 01:44 - Om Paglu: Then I was a bit fine and we had a normal Convo
17/08/2025, 01:44 - Om Paglu: But when I was going through the WhatsApp chats again,I realised I should have never spoken to him normally
17/08/2025, 01:44 - Om Paglu: He's a manipulator
17/08/2025, 01:45 - Parth Bansal: Expected
17/08/2025, 01:45 - Om Paglu: He just quarrels whenever he feels like and when he suddenly realised that I m angry and that no one cares for him so much,he asked for forgiveness
17/08/2025, 01:45 - Om Paglu: He wants attention
17/08/2025, 01:46 - Om Paglu: That's why he speaks to me

17/08/2025, 01:47 - Om Paglu: That's making me even more angry
17/08/2025, 01:47 - Om Paglu: I wish I never met him

17/08/2025, 01:49 - Om Paglu: After today i really don't believe in love anymore
17/08/2025, 01:49 - Parth Bansal: Okk i get it but you should consider sleeping fr 
all these emotions will dampen out and you will actually think using your brain
17/08/2025, 01:49 - Om Paglu: Bcoz of him i even started losing all my other friends
17/08/2025, 01:50 - Om Paglu: He's nothing but a mistake in my life

17/08/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: Who never really cared about me
17/08/2025, 01:55 - Om Paglu: Just cared about my attention

17/08/2025, 19:26 - Om Paglu: How is it 0?
17/08/2025, 20:08 - Om Paglu: Do u have the solutions to the AiDs problems
17/08/2025, 22:02 - Parth Bansal: Bro it makes total sense
Suppose ur random  variable could values between 0 and 1 what is the prob that its 0.345622
Its obv 0 because there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1
17/08/2025, 22:02 - Parth Bansal: <Media omitted>
17/08/2025, 22:02 - Parth Bansal: New problems only

17/08/2025, 22:02 - Parth Bansal: They are solutions
17/08/2025, 22:02 - Om Paglu: Ohh lol
17/08/2025, 22:02 - Om Paglu: Thanks
17/08/2025, 22:03 - Om Paglu: I didn't get it
17/08/2025, 22:03 - Parth Bansal: How many numbers are there between 0 and 1
17/08/2025, 22:03 - Parth Bansal: ?
17/08/2025, 22:03 - Om Paglu: Infinite
17/08/2025, 22:04 - Parth Bansal: What is the probability that the number u chose shows up if there are infinite possibilities?
17/08/2025, 22:04 - Om Paglu: Very less...1/infinite... tending to 0
17/08/2025, 22:04 - Parth Bansal: Yea
17/08/2025, 22:04 - Om Paglu: But it's not 0 na
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Parth Bansal: Bro it is exactly 0
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: Then to probability for every number will b 0
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Parth Bansal: Yes
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: So it's 0 for all?
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Parth Bansal: Probability of a particular number showing up is 0
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: Even the number say 0.005
17/08/2025, 22:05 - Om Paglu: It is also 0

17/08/2025, 22:33 - Parth Bansal: Thats PMF
17/08/2025, 22:33 - Parth Bansal: It will be wrong
17/08/2025, 22:33 - Om Paglu: So whenever it's written cdf,we need to write in interval format?
17/08/2025, 22:34 - Om Paglu: And for pmf,we need to write in = format?

30/08/2025, 11:52 - Parth Bansal: Umm okay, but i cant tell the prof your query because the first question he is going to ask is which division and which elective
30/08/2025, 11:52 - Om Paglu: Meaning?
30/08/2025, 11:52 - Om Paglu: Which prof?
30/08/2025, 11:53 - Parth Bansal: Meaning tell Chirantan that you will have an unavoidable clash then he will escalate your issue to the prof because I can't even if I wanted to
30/08/2025, 11:53 - Om Paglu: Ohk fine
30/08/2025, 11:53 - Om Paglu: Thanks though

30/08/2025, 11:57 - Om Paglu: Bcoz of this unavoidable presentation
30/08/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: But this doesn't make sense shouldn't he go with the majority
30/08/2025, 11:57 - Om Paglu: Plz try to understand...in case he takes the quiz I have no option other than to miss it
30/08/2025, 11:57 - Om Paglu: Bcoz i can't avoid the presentation
30/08/2025, 11:57 - Parth Bansal: I can understand but why did you take an elective under such a prof
30/08/2025, 11:58 - Om Paglu: Bcoz it's fun yaar...also most importantly all aero profs r like this
30/08/2025, 11:58 - Om Paglu: Especially in 4th sem,the elective I m planning on taking
30/08/2025, 11:58 - Parth Bansal: "Fun" for you
30/08/2025, 11:58 - Parth Bansal: Not fun for avg people

30/08/2025, 11:59 - Parth Bansal: Now i will have to answer S1 people why is the quiz on 12th even after a clear majority
30/08/2025, 11:59 - Om Paglu: Ik bro...so tell me what should I do? should I try speaking to my aero prof regarding this ?😭
30/08/2025, 12:00 - Om Paglu: I mean I can try my best
30/08/2025, 12:00 - Om Paglu: But he won't accept
30/08/2025, 12:00 - Parth Bansal: Wait and watch

30/08/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: Plz yaar, don't u all form a bond and revolt against me😭...even I wanted 6th,but I can't help😭
30/08/2025, 12:01 - Parth Bansal: Just dont do anything let Chirantan carry your query to prof let him shift the date and then see what you want to do
30/08/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: Ok fine
30/08/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: But 12th is really gonna b hectic
30/08/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: But can't help😭😭😭
30/08/2025, 12:01 - Om Paglu: I mean u could have given the pole earlier
30/08/2025, 12:01 - Parth Bansal: Suppose prof cancels Chirantan's request because of the course being an elective
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: Then you would request your aero prof for no reason
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: Matlab lets see
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: If prof
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: Changes
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: The date
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Om Paglu: But yaar...in this course we don't have midsem and endsem
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Parth Bansal: Damn
30/08/2025, 12:02 - Om Paglu: So presentation is absolutely mandatory
30/08/2025, 12:03 - Om Paglu: Along with 5 quizzes

30/08/2025, 12:03 - Om Paglu: And grading is with mtech ppl
30/08/2025, 12:03 - Om Paglu: So it's not gonna b easy

30/08/2025, 12:03 - Parth Bansal: Because then grade wont matter
30/08/2025, 12:03 - Parth Bansal: Duy
30/08/2025, 12:03 - Om Paglu: Then what's the motivation force to study hard
30/08/2025, 12:04 - Om Paglu: Exactly...then ik that I won't study
30/08/2025, 12:04 - Om Paglu: That's why
30/08/2025, 12:04 - Parth Bansal: Is grade the only motivation for you to study aero? <This message was edited>
30/08/2025, 12:04 - Om Paglu: Obviously not🤣
30/08/2025, 12:05 - Om Paglu: Also I came to know about this grading scheme afterwards...so had no option 🐥🐥

30/08/2025, 12:05 - Om Paglu: See whatever has happened can't b changed now,right?
30/08/2025, 12:05 - Om Paglu: So there's no point thinking of the past🐒
